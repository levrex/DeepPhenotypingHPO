Editing activities of ARSs further increase translation fidelity by preventing misacylation of tRNAs with non-cognate amino acids. In mammals, ARSs can be distinguished by their cytoplasmatic or mitochondrial localization, with only two ARS in both compartments (GARS and KARS).

The study was approved by the ethics committees of the University Hospital Heidelberg, the Technische Universität München, the Jikei University School of Medicine, Chiba Children’s Hospital and Saitama Medical University, and the Medical University of Innsbruck. performed on genomic DNA from individual #65269 (DEU) did not identify likely clinically relevant variants in genes previously associated with the observed clinical phenotype or a mitochondrial disorder.,  A search for homozygous or potentially compound heterozygous rare variants (MAF &lt; 0.1% in 7,000 in-house , 1000 Genomes Study) prioritized the five genes PROB1, UBR2 (MIM: ), IARS, PLXNB3 (MIM: ), and DUSP21 (MIM: ). Given the overlap of clinical features of the investigated individual with the phenotypic spectrum of other ARS defects, we considered IARS a strong candidate. Results of two independent exome sequencing studies that revealed biallelic IARS variants in two unrelated individuals from Austria and Japan with phenotypic features like those in the German boy supplied further evidence for a causal association of biallelic IARS variants with the disease presentation. All six identified IARS variants were confirmed by . Carrier testing confirmed a compound heterozygous state of the IARS variants (). Except for the variant c.1252C&gt;T, which was detected three times in a heterozygous state, none of the IARS variants (c.760C&gt;T, c.1109T&gt;G, c.1310C&gt;T, c.2974A&gt;G, and c.3521T&gt;A) was listed in &gt;120,000 alleles of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Server (12/2015). All the missense mutations change evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues () and are accordingly predicted to be damaging (PolyPhen-2 and SIFT).

In the TET-ILS1 strain, expression of ILS1, the<br>of human IARS, can be negatively regulated by addition of doxycycline to the growth medium. The strain shows normal growth under standard conditions (). Reduced expression of ILS1 resulted in considerable growth impairment; however, this phenotype was fully rescued by expression of the human wild-type IARS cDNA (, first two lines) providing an in vivo assay to evaluate mutant alleles. IARS cDNAs carrying the different variants were cloned into the low-copy vector pYX122 (Novagen) and growth was compared to that of cells transformed with a wild-type copy of IARS or with the empty vector.<br>Figure 2.

Cells grown overnight were inoculated into fresh medium containing doxycycline. OD600 = 0.1; growth monitored at 30°C.<br>(D)  after 12.5 hr of growth, expressed as percentage of WT. All variants significantly impaired the growth rate (Wilcoxon test, p &lt; 0.05).<br>Representative data are shown.<br>Without addition of doxycycline, the transformed yeast strains grew like the positive control. Upon downregulation of the yeast IARS ortholog, no growth rescue was observed in yeast transformed with empty vector (negative control), plasmids encoding the two IARS loss-of-function variants c.1252C&gt;T (p. Arg418) (#65269, DEU) and c.760C&gt;T (p. Arg254) (#85880, JPN), or a plasmid encoding the missense variant c.2974A&gt;G (p. Asn992Asp) (#83921, AUT).

CONF: 1" >affected</span>  human individual is compound heterozygous for an IARS loss-of-function allele and an allele with significantly reduced but some remaining functionality, similar to the allele causing weak calf syndrome. Treatment with zinc appeared beneficial in subject #65269 (DEU), possibly due to zinc deficiency or to zinc dependence of IARS activity, as shown for the E. coli ortholog. Supplementation using a wide range of zinc concentrations did not improve yeast growth, permitting argument that zinc has no direct effect on IARS activity.<br>To gain further insight into the expression pattern of IARS and its role for , we undertook  and  (MO) knockdown of iars in zebrafish. Iars is conserved in zebrafish and shares 74% homology to the human protein. The expression of iars is ubiquitous in zebrafish during early embryonic development. It localizes to the  and developing brain regions after , especially in the tectum region of the brain, pineal gland, and hindbrain (). To assess Iars function, two splice-blocking MOs specific to iars were injected into zebrafish embryos. MO specificity was validated by  and injection of 5-bp-mismatch MOs ( and data not shown). Upon iars downregulation, embryonic development is generally delayed, with embryos exhibiting altered brain configuration and severe shortening of the posterior body axis (). The observed phenotype had a high consistency of about 85% for both MOs. Notably, the knockdown resulted in a concentration-dependent high level of lethality. Embryos injected with 0.5 ng and 1 ng MO targeting exon 32 showed 40% (n = 35) and 80% (n = 95) lethality rates, respectively, while 80% and 85% of embryos died upon injection of the same concentrations of MO targeting exon 18 (n0.5ng = 37 and n1ng = 87). Lethality rate was decreased to 41% (n = 93) by addition of human IARS mRNA, confirming the MO targeting exon 18 specificity and, at the same time, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for iars in embryonic development. As in yeast, zinc treatment did not result in a phenotypic rescue (data not shown). Overall the experiments performed in this animal model suggest an important role for Iars in embryogenesis. Downregulation of iars causes high lethality, with surviving embryos exhibiting a severe and consistent brain phenotype and a shortening of the body axis reminiscent of the human phenotype.<br>Figure 3.  and  Knockdown of iars in Zebrafish<br>Zebrafish were maintained and embryos were staged as described.

CONF: 1" > affecte</span> d calves, which are homozygous for a single substitution mutation) and by the mainly lethal, severe phenotype of MO knockdown zebrafish. The pathomechanism of IARS deficiency is not yet understood. Although reduced growth could be explained by altered global translational performance, the pathomechanism of organ-specific signs is likely to be more complex. Given the ubiquitous presence and vital importance of ARSs in all cells of archae, bacteria, and , it is remarkable that mutations in ARSs cause considerably distinct clinical pictures with tissue-specific phenotypes in humans., ,  Apart from aminoacylation and editing activity, the so-called canonical functions of ARSs, some ARSs exhibit non-canonical activities in vertebrates. These include translational control, , , and modulation of cell migration, , inflammation, and tumorigenesis.,  IARS also is part of a multi-synthetase complex (MSC), which is organized by nine cytoplasmic ARSs and the three  synthetase-interacting  AIMP1, AIMP2, and AIMP3.,  Tissue specificity has been speculatively linked to such non-canonical functions or to involvement in the MSC. Interestingly, deficiencies of LARS and MARS also are known to cause hepatopathy,,  and these enzymes also are part of the MSC. To propose a role of MSC dysfunction in hepatobiliary disease thus lies near at hand, perhaps through accumulation of mis-folded proteins, with  in consequence, due to incorrect editing of amino acids. An important role for iars in zebrafish brain development is consonant with the  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0012443

The beneficial effect of zinc supplementation observed in human subjects could not be demonstrated in the yeast or zebrafish models. Therefore, IARS  seems to be independent of zinc levels and the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation is likely compensating secondary zinc deficiency. However, zinc has been proposed to interact with the active site of IARS and to be required for normal cell growth. A role for zinc, especially in editing , has been demonstrated for other ARSs, including alanyl-, seryl-, and threonyl-tRNA synthetase., , ,  The cause of zinc deficiency as observed in all our three probands remains unresolved, but could be explained by chronic <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0001392
