To evaluate the functional relevance of identified IARS variants, we made use of a Tet-Off yeast model.. In the TET-ILS1 strain, expression of ILS1, the<br>of human IARS, can be negatively regulated by addition of doxycycline to the growth medium.. The strain shows normal growth under standard conditions ().. Reduced expression of ILS1 resulted in considerable growth impairment; however, this phenotype was fully rescued by expression of the human wild-type IARS cDNA (, first two lines) providing an invivo assay to evaluate mutant alleles.. IARS cDNAs carrying the different variants were cloned into the low-copy vector pYX122 (Novagen) and growth was compared to that of cells transformed with a wild-type copy of IARS or with the empty vector.<br>.

Although reduced growth could be explained by altered global translational performance, the pathomechanism of organ-specific signs is likely to be more complex.. Given the ubiquitous presence and vital importance of ARSs in all cells of archae, bacteria, and , it is remarkable that mutations in ARSs cause considerably distinct clinical pictures with tissue-specific phenotypes in humans., ,  Apart from aminoacylation and editing activity, the so-called canonical functions of ARSs, some ARSs exhibit non-canonical activities in vertebrates..
