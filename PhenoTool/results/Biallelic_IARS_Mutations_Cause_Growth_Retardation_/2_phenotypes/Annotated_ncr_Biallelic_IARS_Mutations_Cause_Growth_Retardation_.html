Individual #65269 (DEU), a boy, was born at 38weeks gestational age to non-consanguineous German parents. Birth weight and head circumference were low (weight 2,020 g, 3.0 SDS; head circumference 29.0cm, 4.2 SDS; see )., PROB1, UBR2 (MIM: ), IARS, PLXNB3 (MIM: ), and DUSP21 (MIM: ). Given the overlap of clinical features of the investigated individual with the phenotypic spectrum of other ARS defects, we considered IARS a strong candidate. Results of two independent exome sequencing studies that revealed biallelic IARS variants in two unrelated individuals from Austria and Japan with phenotypic features like those in the German boy supplied further evidence for a causal association of biallelic IARS variants with the disease presentation. All six identified IARSIARS variants (). Except for the variant c.1252C&gt;T, which was detected three times in a heterozygous state, none of the IARS variants (c.760C&gt;T, c.1109T&gt;G, c.1310C&gt;T, c.2974A&gt;G, and c.3521T&gt;A) was listed in &gt;120,000 alleles of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Server (12/2015). All the missense mutations change evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues () and are accordingly predicted to be damaging (PolyPhen-2 and SIFT). Immunoblotting analysis of fibroblast cell extracts from all three affected individuals showed reduced levels of IARS protein only for subject #65269 (DEU; see ). Four of the six mutations lie in the first half of the gene, in close proximity to the IleRS core domain (). To evaluate the functional relevance of identified IARS variants, we made use of a Tet-Off yeast model. In the TET-ILS1 strain, expression of ILS1, the IARS, can be negatively regulated by addition of doxycycline to the growth medium. The strain shows normal growth under standard conditions (). Reduced expression of ILS1 resulted in considerable  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0001510
CONF: 0.8645337" >growth impairment</span> ; however, this phenotype was fully rescued by expression of the human wild-type IARS cDNA (, first two lines) providing an invivo assay to evaluate mutant alleles. IARS cDNAs carrying the different variants were cloned into the low-copy vector pYX122 (Novagen) and growth was compared to that of cells transformed with a wild-type copy of IARS or with the empty vector. Without addition of doxycycline, the transformed yeast strains grew like the positive control. Upon downregulation of the yeast IARS ortholog, no growth rescue was observed in yeast transformed with empty vector (negative control), plasmids encoding the two IARS loss-of-function variants c.1252C&gt;T (p. Arg418) (#65269, DEU) and c.760C&gt;T (p. Arg254IARS in cattle, which underlies weak  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0002981
CONF: 0.81171274" >calf</span>  syndrome), c.3521T&gt;A (p. Ile1174Asn) (#65269, DEU), c.1310C&gt;T (p. Pro437Leu) (#85880, JPN), and c.1109T&gt;G (p. Val370Gly) (#83921, AUT); the last displayed the mildest, but significant,  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0001510
CONF: 0.8645338" >growth impairment</span>  (). Hence, each affected human individual is compound heterozygous for an IARS loss-of-function allele and an allele with significantly reduced but some remaining functionality, similar to the allele causing weak  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0002981
CONF: 0.81171274" >calf</span>  syndrome. Treatment with zinc appeared beneficial in subject #65269 (DEU), possibly due to zinc deficiency or to zinc dependence of IARS activity, as shown for the E.coli ortholog. Supplementation using a wide range of zinc concentrations did not improve yeast growth, permitting argument that zinc has no direct effect on IARS activity. To gain further insight into the expression pattern of IARSiars in zebrafish. Iars is conserved in zebrafish and shares 74% homology to the human protein. The expression of iars). To assess Iars function, two splice-blocking MOs specific to iars and data not shown). Upon iars downregulation, embryonic development is generally delayed, with embryos exhibiting altered  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0012443
CONF: 0.82531583" >brain</span>  configuration and severe shortening of the posterior body axis (). The observed phenotype had a high consistency of about 85% for both MOs. Notably, the knockdown resulted in a concentration-dependent high level of lethality. Embryos injected with 0.5ng and 1ng MO targeting exon 32 showed 40% (n = 35) and 80% (n= 95) lethality rates, respectively, while 80% and 85% of embryos died upon injection ofthesame concentrations of MO targeting exon 18 (n0.5ng = 37 and n1ng = 87). Lethality rate was decreased to 41% (n = 93) by addition of human IARS mRNA, confirming the MO targeting exon 18 specificity and, at the same time, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for iars in embryonic development. As in yeast, zinc treatment did not result in a phenotypic rescue (data not shown). Overall the experiments performed in this animal model suggest an important role for Iars in embryogenesis. Downregulation of iars causes high lethality, with surviving embryos exhibiting a severe and consistent  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0012443
CONF: 0.82531583" >brain</span>  phenotype and a shortening of the body axis reminiscent of the human phenotype. Mutations in IARS recently have been identified as underlying weak  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0002981
CONF: 0.81171274" >calf</span>  syndrome in Japanese black cattle.). Thus, OXPHOS dysfunction is not directly linked to mutations in IARS). Hence it is likely that  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0031831
CONF: 0.8898409" >reduced zinc levels</span>  and impaired OXPHOS activities are not directly related to IARS mutations.
