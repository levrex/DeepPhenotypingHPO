Entity0 Table 1. Genetic and Clinical Findings in Individuals with IARS Mutations Entity1 Figure1. IARS Variants and Gene Structure(A) Pedigrees of the three families with recessive inherited mutations in IARS. (B) Structure of IARS with known conserved protein domains in the gene product and localization and conservation of amino acid residues affected by mutations identified in the three families as well as by the orthologous-gene mutation associated with the weak calf syndrome. Intronic regions are not drawn to scale. Coloring in the sequence alignment represents the identity of amino acid residues. Entity2 Figure2. Yeast StudiesSpot assay and growth curves of TET-ILS1 strain, transformed with the low copy vector pYX122 (Novagen) containing different mutated versions of human IARS cDNA encoding the protein products hsIARS WT, pYX122:hIARS: hsIARS V79L, pYX122:hiars: hsIARS I1174N, pYX122:hiars: hsIARS R418, pYX122:hiars: hsIARS R254, pYX122:hiars: hsIARS P437L, pYX122:hiars: hsIARS V370G, pYX122:hiars: and hsIARS N992D, pYX122:hiars. Empty vector pYX, pYX122, was used as a negative control. Decreasing numbers of yeast cells (5 10, 5 10, 5 10, 5 10, 5 10) were spotted onto plates containing drop-out medium (SC-His). Growth curves were obtained in liquid cultures with SC-His medium by monitoring OD600. Downregulation of yeast ILS1 was induced by addition of 50mg/mL doxycycline. (A) Expression of the different IARS WT and mutant constructs in the TET-ILS1 strain did not show any negative effect on growth.

In Situ Hybridization and Morpholino Knockdown of iars in ZebrafishZebrafish were maintained and embryos were staged as described. Embryos older than 24hr after fertilization (hpf) were treated with 0.0003% phenylthiourea (Sigma) to inhibit pigment synthesis and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) previous to insitu hybridization. The insitu hybridization protocol was adapted using specific probes for the iars mRNAs. The MOs usedwere splice blocking and 5-bp-mismatch control MOs, designed and synthesized by Gene Tools (exon 18 MO: 5-ATGTGTGGTTTGTTTTCTCACCGTA-3, exon 18 5-bp-mismatch 5-ATaTGTaGTTTaTTTTCTaACCaTA-3: exon 32 MO: 5-ACCGTCTGACAGCAGAACACACAGA-3, exon 32 5-bp mismatch: 5-AaCGTCTaACAGaAGAACAaACAaA-3).
