Zinc deficiency was present in all affected individuals and supplementation with zinc showed a beneficial effect on growth in one.<br> <h2>Main Text</h2> Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNAs by their cognate amino acid, linking amino acids with the correct nucleotide triplets and ensuring the correct transformation of the genetic code to the protein level. Editing activities of ARSs further increase translation fidelity by preventing misacylation of tRNAs with non-cognate amino acids. In mammals, ARSs can be distinguished by their cytoplasmatic or mitochondrial localization, with only two ARS in both compartments (GARS and KARS). In 2003, autosomal-dominant Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) type 2D (MIM: 601472) and neuropathy, distal hereditary motor, type VA (MIM: 600794), caused by mutations in  GARS  (MIM: 600287, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase) were reported as the first ARS-associated human disease phenotypes. Since then, several clinical conditions associated with mutations in mitochondrial ARSs3, 4 and cytosolic ARSs have been identified. Clinically, most cytosolic tRNA synthetase deficiencies are associated with CMT and related neuropathies, whereas mutations in  LARS  (MIM: 151350) cause infantile  <span style="color:lime" title="HPO: HP:0001392

The study was approved by the ethics committees of the University Hospital Heidelberg, the Technische Universitat Munchen, the Jikei University School of Medicine, Chiba Childrens Hospital and Saitama Medical University, and the Medical University of Innsbruck. Whole-exome sequencing performed on genomic DNA from individual #65269 (DEU) did not identify likely clinically relevant variants in genes previously associated with the observed clinical phenotype or a mitochondrial disorder.10, 11 A search for homozygous or potentially compound heterozygous rare variants (MAF &lt: 0.1% in 7,000 in-house exomes, 1000 Genomes Study) prioritized the five genes  PROB1 ,  UBR2  (MIM: 609134),  IARS ,  PLXNB3  (MIM: 300214), and  DUSP21  (MIM: 300678). Given the overlap of clinical features of the investigated individual with the phenotypic spectrum of other ARS defects, we considered  IARS  a strong candidate. Results of two independent exome sequencing studies that revealed biallelic  IARS  variants in two unrelated individuals from Austria and Japan with phenotypic features like those in the German boy supplied further evidence for a causal association of biallelic  IARS  variants with the disease presentation. All six identified  IARS  variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Carrier testing confirmed a compound heterozygous state of the IARS  variants (Figure1). Except for the variant c.1252C&gt:T, which was detected three times in a heterozygous state, none of the  IARS  variants (c.760C&gt:T, c.1109T&gt:G, c.1310C&gt:T, c.2974A&gt:G, and c.3521T&gt:A) was listed in &gt:120,000 alleles of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Server (12/2015).

Hence, each affected human individual is compound heterozygous for an  IARS  loss-of-function allele and an allele with significantly reduced but some remaining functionality, similar to the allele causing weak calf syndrome. Treatment with zinc appeared beneficial in subject #65269 (DEU), possibly due to zinc deficiency or to zinc dependence of IARS activity, as shown for the  E.coli  ortholog. Supplementation using a wide range of zinc concentrations did not improve yeast growth, permitting argument that zinc has no direct effect on IARS activity.<br> To gain further insight into the expression pattern of  IARS  and its role for embryonic development, we undertook insitu hybridization and morpholino (MO) knockdown of  iars  in zebrafish.

Notably, the knockdown resulted in a concentration-dependent high level of lethality. Embryos injected with 0.5ng and 1ng MO targeting exon 32 showed 40% (n = 35) and 80% (n= 95) lethality rates, respectively, while 80% and 85% of embryos died upon injection ofthesame concentrations of MO targeting exon 18 (n0.5ng = 37 and n1ng = 87). Lethality rate was decreased to 41% (n = 93) by addition of human  IARS  mRNA, confirming the MO targeting exon 18 specificity and, at the same time, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for  iars  in embryonic development. As in yeast, zinc treatment did not result in a phenotypic rescue (data not shown). Overall the experiments performed in this animal model suggest an important role for Iars in embryogenesis.

Given the ubiquitous presence and vital importance of ARSs in all cells of archae, bacteria, and eukarya, it is remarkable that mutations in ARSs cause considerably distinct clinical pictures with tissue-specific phenotypes in humans.1, 4, 17 Apart from aminoacylation and editing activity, the so-called canonical functions of ARSs, some ARSs exhibit non-canonical activities in vertebrates. These include translational control, transcription regulation, signal transduction, and modulation of cell migration, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis.1, 18 IARS also is part of a multi-synthetase complex (MSC), which is organized by nine cytoplasmic ARSs and the three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional proteins AIMP1, AIMP2, and AIMP3.19, 20 Tissue specificity has been speculatively linked to such non-canonical functions or to involvement in the MSC. Interestingly, deficiencies of LARS and MARS also are known to cause hepatopathy,6, 7 and these enzymes also are part of the MSC. To propose a role of MSC dysfunction in hepatobiliary disease thus lies near at hand, perhaps through accumulation of mis-folded proteins, with endoplasmic-reticulum stress in consequence, due to incorrect editing of amino acids.

The beneficial effect of zinc supplementation observed in human subjects could not be demonstrated in the yeast or zebrafish models. Therefore, IARS enzyme activity seems to be independent of zinc levels and the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation is likely compensating secondary zinc deficiency. However, zinc has been proposed to interact with the active site of IARS and to be required for normal cell growth. A role for zinc, especially in editing substrate specificity, has been demonstrated for other ARSs, including alanyl-, seryl-, and threonyl-tRNA synthetase.26, 27, 28, 29 The cause of zinc deficiency as observed in all our three probands remains unresolved, but could be explained by chronic  <span style="color:lime" title="HPO: HP:0001392
