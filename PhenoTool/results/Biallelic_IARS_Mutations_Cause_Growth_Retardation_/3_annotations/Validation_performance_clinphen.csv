8|HP:0000252|TP|Microcephaly|An important role for  iars  in zebrafish brain development is consonant with the abnormalities of brain function in the subjects of this study.<br>. Regarding the MRI findings in cytosolic ARS, several open questions remain.. The mild supratentorial white matter T2-hyperintensity in subject #65269 (DEU) is consistent either with a complex pattern of hypomyelination with a normal signal of subcortical, late myelinating white matter or with white matter changes secondary to neurodegeneration: his visually low choline resonances in the quantitiative MRS are also consistent with hypomyelination.. The presumed hypomyelination may be compared with individuals with mutations in  DARS  (MIM: 603084),23, 24 whereas microcephaly is reminiscent of the phenotype seen in individuals with mutations in  QARS  (MIM: 603727)..

In the TET-ILS1 strain, expression of  ILS1 , the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ortholog of human  IARS , can be negatively regulated by addition of doxycycline to the growth medium.. The strain shows normal growth under standard conditions (Figure 2).. Reduced expression of  ILS1  resulted in considerable growth impairment: however, this phenotype was fully rescued by expression of the human wild-type  IARS  cDNA (Figure 2, first two lines) providing an in vivo assay to evaluate mutant alleles..

49|HP:0001510|TP|Growth delay|The  ABCB11  variant identified in individual #83921 (AUT) may contribute to greater severity of liver disease, including cholestasis, in him than in the other individuals with compound heterozygous  IARS  mutations and no rare variants in  ABCB11 .<br>. An essential role of IARS is underlined by the fact that none of the human subjects have two loss-of-function alleles (the same holds for affected calves, which are homozygous for a single substitution mutation) and by the mainly lethal, severe phenotype of MO knockdown zebrafish.. The pathomechanism of IARS deficiency is not yet understood.. Although reduced growth could be explained by altered global translational performance, the pathomechanism of organ-specific signs is likely to be more complex.. Given the ubiquitous presence and vital importance of ARSs in all cells of archae, bacteria, and eukarya, it is remarkable that mutations in ARSs cause considerably distinct clinical pictures with tissue-specific phenotypes in humans.1, 4, 17 Apart from aminoacylation and editing activity, the so-called canonical functions of ARSs, some ARSs exhibit non-canonical activities in vertebrates.. These include translational control, transcription regulation, signal transduction, and modulation of cell migration, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis.1, 18 IARS also is part of a multi-synthetase complex (MSC), which is organized by nine cytoplasmic ARSs and the three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional proteins AIMP1, AIMP2, and AIMP3.19, 20 Tissue specificity has been speculatively linked to such non-canonical functions or to involvement in the MSC.|44.0|{'signs'}|HP:0001510|197.0|Although reduced growth could be explained by altered global translational performance, the pathomechanism of organ-specific signs is likely to be more complex.|['Growth delay']|0.0|#83921|1.0|1.0|Main Text|22.0

Interestingly, deficiencies of LARS and MARS also are known to cause hepatopathy,6, 7 and these enzymes also are part of the MSC.. To propose a role of MSC dysfunction in hepatobiliary disease thus lies near at hand, perhaps through accumulation of mis-folded proteins, with endoplasmic-reticulum stress in consequence, due to incorrect editing of amino acids.. An important role for  iars  in zebrafish brain development is consonant with the abnormalities of brain function in the subjects of this study.<br>. Regarding the MRI findings in cytosolic ARS, several open questions remain.. The mild supratentorial white matter T2-hyperintensity in subject #65269 (DEU) is consistent either with a complex pattern of hypomyelination with a normal signal of subcortical, late myelinating white matter or with white matter changes secondary to neurodegeneration: his visually low choline resonances in the quantitiative MRS are also consistent with hypomyelination.|50.0|{'subjects'}|HP:0012443|202.0|An important role for  iars  in zebrafish brain development is consonant with the abnormalities of brain function in the subjects of this study.<br>|['Abnormality of brain morphology']|0.0|None|1.0|1.0|Main Text|25.0

In 2003, autosomal-dominant Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) type 2D (MIM: 601472) and neuropathy, distal hereditary motor, type VA (MIM: 600794), caused by mutations in  GARS  (MIM: 600287, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase) were reported as the first ARS-associated human disease phenotypes.. Since then, several clinical conditions associated with mutations in mitochondrial ARSs3, 4 and cytosolic ARSs have been identified.. Clinically, most cytosolic tRNA synthetase deficiencies are associated with CMT and related neuropathies, whereas mutations in  LARS  (MIM: 151350) cause infantile acute liver failure syndrome type 1 (MIM: 615438) and autosomal-recessive mutations in  MARS  (MIM: 156560) cause interstitial lung and liver disease (MIM: 615486).<br>.

300|HP:0001658|FP|Myocardial infarction|Given the ubiquitous presence and vital importance of ARSs in all cells of archae, bacteria, and eukarya, it is remarkable that mutations in ARSs cause considerably distinct clinical pictures with tissue-specific phenotypes in humans.1, 4, 17 Apart from aminoacylation and editing activity, the so-called canonical functions of ARSs, some ARSs exhibit non-canonical activities in vertebrates.. These include translational control, transcription regulation, signal transduction, and modulation of cell migration, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis.1, 18 IARS also is part of a multi-synthetase complex (MSC), which is organized by nine cytoplasmic ARSs and the three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional proteins AIMP1, AIMP2, and AIMP3.19, 20 Tissue specificity has been speculatively linked to such non-canonical functions or to involvement in the MSC.. Interestingly, deficiencies of LARS and MARS also are known to cause hepatopathy,6, 7 and these enzymes also are part of the MSC.. To propose a role of MSC dysfunction in hepatobiliary disease thus lies near at hand, perhaps through accumulation of mis-folded proteins, with endoplasmic-reticulum stress in consequence, due to incorrect editing of amino acids.. An important role for  iars  in zebrafish brain development is consonant with the abnormalities of brain function in the subjects of this study.<br>. Regarding the MRI findings in cytosolic ARS, several open questions remain.|66.0|set()|HP:0001658|201.0|To propose a role of MSC dysfunction in hepatobiliary disease thus lies near at hand, perhaps through accumulation of mis-folded proteins, with endoplasmic-reticulum stress in consequence, due to incorrect editing of amino acids.|['Myocardial infarction']|0.0|#83921|1.0|1.0|Main Text|33.0
