Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNAs by their cognate amino acid, linking amino acids with the correct nucleotide triplets and ensuring the correct transformation of the genetic code to the protein level.. Editing activities of ARSs further increase translation fidelity by preventing misacylation of tRNAs with non-cognate amino acids.. In mammals, ARSs can be distinguished by their cytoplasmatic or mitochondrial localization, with only two ARS in both compartments (GARS and KARS)..

To evaluate the functional relevance of identified  IARS  variants, we made use of a Tet-Off yeast model.. In the TET-ILS1 strain, expression of  ILS1 , the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ortholog of human  IARS , can be negatively regulated by addition of doxycycline to the growth medium.. The strain shows normal growth under standard conditions (Figure2).. Reduced expression of  ILS1  resulted in considerable growth impairment: however, this phenotype was fully rescued by expression of the human wild-type  IARS  cDNA (Figure2, first two lines) providing an invivo assay to evaluate mutant alleles.. IARS  cDNAs carrying the different variants were cloned into the low-copy vector pYX122 (Novagen) and growth was compared to that of cells transformed with a wild-type copy of  IARS  or with the empty vector.<br>.

Lethality rate was decreased to 41% (n = 93) by addition of human  IARS  mRNA, confirming the MO targeting exon 18 specificity and, at the same time, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for  iars  in embryonic development.. As in yeast, zinc treatment did not result in a phenotypic rescue (data not shown).. Overall the experiments performed in this animal model suggest an important role for Iars in embryogenesis.. Downregulation of  iars  causes high lethality, with surviving embryos exhibiting a severe and consistent brain phenotype and a shortening of the body axis reminiscent of the human phenotype.<br>. Mutations in  IARS  recently have been identified as underlying weak calf syndrome in Japanese black cattle..

Therefore, IARS enzyme activity seems to be independent of zinc levels and the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation is likely compensating secondary zinc deficiency.. However, zinc has been proposed to interact with the active site of IARS and to be required for normal cell growth..
