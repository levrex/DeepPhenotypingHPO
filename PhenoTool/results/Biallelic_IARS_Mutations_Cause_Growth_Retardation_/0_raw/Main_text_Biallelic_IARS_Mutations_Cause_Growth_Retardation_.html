Since then, several clinical conditions associated with mutations in mitochondrial ARSs,  and cytosolic ARSs whereas mutations in LARS (MIM: ) cause infantile acute liver failure syndrome type 1 (MIM: )MARS (MIM: ) cause interstitial lung and liver disease (MIM: ). Mutations in cytosolic IARS (MIM:  The affected calves exhibit prenatal-onset growth retardation, severe muscle weakness with astasia, and fatty degeneration of liver cells., Here we report the identification of biallelic mutations in IARS in three unrelated individuals with a complex multisystemic phenotype of prenatal-onset growth retardation (3/3), intellectual disability (3/3), muscular hypotonia (2/3), and hepatopathy with fibrosis and steatosis (2/3) aswell as diabetes mellitus and sensorineural hearing loss(1/3). The three individuals studied originate from Germany (#65269, DEU), Japan (#85880, JPN), and Austria (#83921, AUT). Clinical findings are summarized in  (for anthropometrical data see ).

Individual #65269 (DEU), a boy, was born at 38weeks gestational age to non-consanguineous German parents. Birth weight and head circumference were low (weight 2,020 g, 3.0 SDS; head circumference 29.0cm, 4.2 SDS; see )., PROB1, UBR2 (MIM: ), IARS, PLXNB3 (MIM: ), and DUSP21 (MIM: ). Given the overlap of clinical features of the investigated individual with the phenotypic spectrum of other ARS defects, we considered IARS a strong candidate. Results of two independent exome sequencing studies that revealed biallelic IARS variants in two unrelated individuals from Austria and Japan with phenotypic features like those in the German boy supplied further evidence for a causal association of biallelic IARS variants with the disease presentation. All six identified IARSIARS variants (). Except for the variant c.1252C&gt;T, which was detected three times in a heterozygous state, none of the IARS variants (c.760C&gt;T, c.1109T&gt;G, c.1310C&gt;T, c.2974A&gt;G, and c.3521T&gt;A) was listed in &gt;120,000 alleles of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Server (12/2015). All the missense mutations change evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues () and are accordingly predicted to be damaging (PolyPhen-2 and SIFT). Immunoblotting analysis of fibroblast cell extracts from all three affected individuals showed reduced levels of IARS protein only for subject #65269 (DEU; see ). Four of the six mutations lie in the first half of the gene, in close proximity to the IleRS core domain (). To evaluate the functional relevance of identified IARS variants, we made use of a Tet-Off yeast model. In the TET-ILS1 strain, expression of ILS1, the IARS, can be negatively regulated by addition of doxycycline to the growth medium. The strain shows normal growth under standard conditions (). Reduced expression of ILS1 resulted in considerable growth impairment; however, this phenotype was fully rescued by expression of the human wild-type IARS cDNA (, first two lines) providing an invivo assay to evaluate mutant alleles. IARS cDNAs carrying the different variants were cloned into the low-copy vector pYX122 (Novagen) and growth was compared to that of cells transformed with a wild-type copy of IARS or with the empty vector. Without addition of doxycycline, the transformed yeast strains grew like the positive control. Upon downregulation of the yeast IARS ortholog, no growth rescue was observed in yeast transformed with empty vector (negative control), plasmids encoding the two IARS loss-of-function variants c.1252C&gt;T (p. Arg418) (#65269, DEU) and c.760C&gt;T (p. Arg254IARS in cattle, which underlies weak calf syndrome), c.3521T&gt;A (p. Ile1174Asn) (#65269, DEU), c.1310C&gt;T (p. Pro437Leu) (#85880, JPN), and c.1109T&gt;G (p. Val370Gly) (#83921, AUT); the last displayed the mildest, but significant, growth impairment (). Hence, each affected human individual is compound heterozygous for an IARS loss-of-function allele and an allele with significantly reduced but some remaining functionality, similar to the allele causing weak calf syndrome. Treatment with zinc appeared beneficial in subject #65269 (DEU), possibly due to zinc deficiency or to zinc dependence of IARS activity, as shown for the E.coli ortholog. Supplementation using a wide range of zinc concentrations did not improve yeast growth, permitting argument that zinc has no direct effect on IARS activity. To gain further insight into the expression pattern of IARSiars in zebrafish. Iars is conserved in zebrafish and shares 74% homology to the human protein. The expression of iars). To assess Iars function, two splice-blocking MOs specific to iars and data not shown). Upon iars downregulation, embryonic development is generally delayed, with embryos exhibiting altered brain configuration and severe shortening of the posterior body axis (). The observed phenotype had a high consistency of about 85% for both MOs. Notably, the knockdown resulted in a concentration-dependent high level of lethality. Embryos injected with 0.5ng and 1ng MO targeting exon 32 showed 40% (n = 35) and 80% (n= 95) lethality rates, respectively, while 80% and 85% of embryos died upon injection ofthesame concentrations of MO targeting exon 18 (n0.5ng = 37 and n1ng = 87). Lethality rate was decreased to 41% (n = 93) by addition of human IARS mRNA, confirming the MO targeting exon 18 specificity and, at the same time, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for iars in embryonic development. As in yeast, zinc treatment did not result in a phenotypic rescue (data not shown). Overall the experiments performed in this animal model suggest an important role for Iars in embryogenesis. Downregulation of iars causes high lethality, with surviving embryos exhibiting a severe and consistent brain phenotype and a shortening of the body axis reminiscent of the human phenotype. Mutations in IARS recently have been identified as underlying weak calf syndrome in Japanese black cattle.). Thus, OXPHOS dysfunction is not directly linked to mutations in IARS). Hence it is likely that reduced zinc levels and impaired OXPHOS activities are not directly related to IARS mutations. Our genetic and experimental findings provide evidence that mutations affecting functionally conserved domains in IARS cause a multisystem phenotype in man including severe growth retardation with prenatal onset, intellectual disability, muscular hypotonia, and infantile hepatopathy. All three individuals presented in this study share principal clinical features, but phenotypes vary. The neurological phenotype in individual #65269 (DEU) is severe, including absence of expressive speech, spasticity, pronounced white matter deficit, and severe microcephaly, whereas individual #85880 (JPN) has moderate intellectual disability without motor dysfunction and with normal findings on brain MRI. It cannot be excluded that the intellectual disability of individual #85880 (JPN) is modified by another cause than IARS mutations, because her sister, who did not harbor the identified pathogenic IARS variants, is also affected by intellectual disability. However, in the families of individuals #65269 (DEU) and #83921 (AUT), family histories for intellectual disability are unremarkable. Liver function was basically normal in individual #65269 (DEU), whereas infantile hepatopathy (leading to liver failure in one occasion) was present in the other two probands, with steatosis and portal-tract fibrosis. Liver biopsy of individual #83921 (AUT) additionally displayed cholestasis. Among 107 rare or private variants identifiedinthe exome of this subject was a heterozygous c.1460G&gt;A (p. Arg487His) change in  (MIM: ). Heterozygous ABCB11 mutations are implicated as predisposing to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and to transient neonatal cholestasis. The ABCB11 variant identified in individual #83921 (AUT) may contribute to greater severity of liver disease, including cholestasis, in him than in the other individuals with compound heterozygous IARS mutations and no rare variants in ABCB11., , , ,  Tissue specificity has been speculatively linked to such non-canonical functions or to involvement in the MSC. Interestingly, deficiencies of LARS and MARS also are known to cause hepatopathy,,  An important role for iars in zebrafish brain development is consonant with the abnormalities of brain function in the subjects of this study. DARS (MIM: ),,  whereas microcephaly is reminiscent of the phenotype seen in individuals with mutations in QARS (MIM: ). A simplified gyral pattern is not apparent, however, in the individuals with mutations in IARS, , ,  The cause of zinc deficiency as observed in all our three probands remains unresolved, but could be explained by chronic liver disease at least in individuals AUT and JPN, because chronic liver disease is known to be associated with zinc deficiency., In recent years, whole-exome sequencing studies haverevealed various causes of infantile liver failure with partly specific clinical phenotypes, including mutations in LARS, NBAS (MIM: ),,  SCYL1 (MIM: ), and now IARS. Precise genetic and clinical phenotyping is crucial for both understanding these diseases and for suspecting and diagnosing them in the clinical setting. This study delineates mutations in IARS as underlying a multisystemic disease affecting mainly growth, brain, and liver. For reasons yet to be determined, this disease is associated with zinc deficiency and can be palliated by zinc supplementation.
