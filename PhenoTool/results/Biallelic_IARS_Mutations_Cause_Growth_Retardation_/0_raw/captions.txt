Figure1. IARS Variants and Gene Structure(A) Pedigrees of the three families with recessive inherited mutations in IARS.(B) Structure of IARS with known conserved protein domains in the gene product and localization and conservation of amino acid residues affected by mutations identified in the three families as well as by the orthologous-gene mutation associated with the weak calf syndrome. Intronic regions are not drawn to scale. Coloring in the sequence alignment represents the identity of amino acid residues.

Figure2. Yeast StudiesSpot assay and growth curves of TET-ILS1 strain, transformed with the low copy vector pYX122 (Novagen) containing different mutated versions of human IARS cDNA encoding the protein products hsIARS WT, pYX122:hIARS; hsIARS V79L, pYX122:hiars; hsIARS I1174N, pYX122:hiars; hsIARS R418, pYX122:hiars; hsIARS R254, pYX122:hiars; hsIARS P437L, pYX122:hiars; hsIARS V370G, pYX122:hiars; and hsIARS N992D, pYX122:hiars. Empty vector pYX, pYX122, was used as a negative control. Decreasing numbers of yeast cells (5 10, 5 10, 5 10, 5 10, 5 10) were spotted onto plates containing drop-out medium (SC-His). Growth curves were obtained in liquid cultures with SC-His medium by monitoring OD600. Downregulation of yeast ILS1 was induced by addition of 50mg/mL doxycycline.(A) Expression of the different IARS WT and mutant constructs in the TET-ILS1 strain did not show any negative effect on growth.(B) Downregulation of ILS1 led to failure in growth that could be rescued by expression of human wild-type IARS. Each affected individual carries one loss-of-function allele in combination with one allele that displays residual activity as measured by growth. Transformation with a construct encoding the variant associated with the perinatal weak calf syndrome resulted in partial rescue of the growth defect.(C) Growth in liquid culture. Cells grown overnight were inoculated into fresh medium containing doxycycline. OD600 = 0.1; growth monitored at 30C.(D) Optical density after 12.5hr of growth, expressed as percentage of WT. All variants significantly impaired the growth rate (Wilcoxon test, p < 0.05).Representative data are shown.

Figure3. In Situ Hybridization and Morpholino Knockdown of iars in ZebrafishZebrafish were maintained and embryos were staged as described. Embryos older than 24hr after fertilization (hpf) were treated with 0.0003% phenylthiourea (Sigma) to inhibit pigment synthesis and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) previous to insitu hybridization. The insitu hybridization protocol was adapted using specific probes for the iars mRNAs. The MOs usedwere splice blocking and 5-bp-mismatch control MOs, designed and synthesized by Gene Tools (exon 18 MO: 5-ATGTGTGGTTTGTTTTCTCACCGTA-3, exon 18 5-bp-mismatch 5-ATaTGTaGTTTaTTTTCTaACCaTA-3; exon 32 MO: 5-ACCGTCTGACAGCAGAACACACAGA-3, exon 32 5-bp mismatch: 5-AaCGTCTaACAGaAGAACAaACAaA-3). Single-cell stage embryos were injected with 0.5ng of MO and maintained at 28C until the desired developmental stage was attained.Lateral views with anterior to the left at developmental stages indicated.(A) In situ hybridization for iars mRNA at 13 hpf and sense mRNA control. Iars expression localizes predominantly to the somites and developing brain regions. The arrow indicates midbrain expression.(B) 25 hpf. Iars insitu (left), arrows indicate tectum (blue), cerebellum (black), and somites (red). Sense control (right) shows no signal.(C) 48 hpf. Iars is specifically expressed in the tectum region of the brain (blue), as well as in the pineal gland (green) and hindbrain (black).(D) MO-injected zebrafish embryos at 26 hpf are shown. Knockdown of iars yields retarded development, brain deformity, as indicated by the arrow to the midbrain region, and severe shortening of the body axis, as highlighted by the double head arrows. Left, control embryo; middle, zebrafish injected with MO targeting exon 18; right, zebrafish injected with MO targeting exon 32.
