Fig. 2. Long-term continuous video EEG. The resting awake background consists of well-modulated, well-sustained, posterior dominant alpha rhythm at 9-10 Hz and 40-50 mV, which attenuated with eye opening and reoccurred with eye closure. There are frequent spike-and-slow waves with phase reversal at F8 and T4, along with intermittent slow waves at 4-5 Hz seen over the right temporal region. There are also independent sharp waves with phase reversal at T3 and T5. Frequent periodic lateralized discharges are seen in the right temporal region with phase reversal at F8 and T4. A focal onset seizure originating from the right mesial temporal region was captured lasting 37 s. This is seen on EEG as sharp waves which build up in the right temporal region before spreading to the right parasagittal region. On video, the patient was asleep. He woke up from sleep without any other clinical motor signs.
FIGURE 2:
Fig. 3. Intraoperative ECoG (A) Before resection. Frequent high voltage epileptiform discharges from middle inferior temporal region. No epileptiform discharges seen in the temporal cortical convexity. (B) After resection. Epileptiform discharges decreased significantly. Very infrequent small sharp waves seen in the mid temporal region.
