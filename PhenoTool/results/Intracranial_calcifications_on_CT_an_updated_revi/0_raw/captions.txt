Findings: Blush-like calcifications within the bilateral basal ganglia (arrows) including the thalami early in the course of the disease. In addition, there is decreased bifrontal peri-ventricular density from demyelination (arrowheads). (f) 3-month-old infant girl with AGS. Findings: Conglomerate of intracranial calcifications almost equally involving the basal ganglia (arrows) including the thalami. There is slight ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricles and slight prominence of cerebral sulci secondary to volume loss. (g): 42-year-old man with Fahr disease. Findings: Conglomerate/mass like calcifications in the bilateral basal ganglia (short arrows), bilateral cerebellar white matter and dentate nuclei (long arrows).

Technique: Axial non-enhanced CT, 450 mAs, 120 kV, 0.8 mm slice thickness. (a): 10-month-old infant boy with seizures and neonatal CMV infection. Findings: Reticular calcification pattern in the subependymal (long arrows) and periventricular region (short arrows) with mild ventriculomegaly. (b): 21-year-old female with congenital toxoplasma infection. Findings: Dots of calcification in the periventricular (long arrow) and subcortical (short arrow) regions with brain destruction, volume loss and ex-vacuo dilatation of the ventricles.
