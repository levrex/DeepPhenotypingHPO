Fig. 1. Pulmonary tuberculosis complication. Chest X-ray at admission face (A) and profile (B) showing diffuse infiltrative pneumopathy complicated by complete left lung parenchymal destruction with pneumothorax and fluid colonization of the spaces (air-fluid level showing same diameter on posteroanterior and lateral view). This coexists with a widespread oligemia of the right lung excessively inflated encompassing rare macular, peribronchovascular haziness and some bands of fibrosis particularly in the supra-hilar zone that may be associated to the well-known long-term tuberculosis.
