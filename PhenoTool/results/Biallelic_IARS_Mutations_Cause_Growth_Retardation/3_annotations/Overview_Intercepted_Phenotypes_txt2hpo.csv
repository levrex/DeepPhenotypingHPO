Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNAs by their cognate amino acid, linking amino acids with the correct nucleotide triplets and ensuring the correct transformation of the genetic code to the protein level.. Editing activities of ARSs further increase translation fidelity by preventing misacylation of tRNAs with non-cognate amino acids.. In mammals, ARSs can be distinguished by their cytoplasmatic or mitochondrial localization, with only two ARS in both compartments (GARS and KARS).. In 2003, autosomal-dominant Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) type 2D (MIM: 601472) and neuropathy, distal hereditary motor, type VA (MIM: 600794), caused by mutations in  GARS  (MIM: 600287, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase) were reported as the first ARS-associated human disease phenotypes.. Since then, several clinical conditions associated with mutations in mitochondrial ARSs3, 4 and cytosolic ARSs have been identified.. Clinically, most cytosolic tRNA synthetase deficiencies are associated with CMT and related neuropathies, whereas mutations in  LARS  (MIM: 151350) cause infantile acute liver failure syndrome type 1 (MIM: 615438) and autosomal-recessive mutations in  MARS  (MIM: 156560) cause interstitial lung and liver disease (MIM: 615486).<br>|98.0|set()|HP:0009830|20.0|In 2003, autosomal-dominant Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) type 2D (MIM: 601472) and neuropathy, distal hereditary motor, type VA (MIM: 600794), caused by mutations in  GARS  (MIM: 600287, encoding glycyl-tRNA synthetase) were reported as the first ARS-associated human disease phenotypes.|0.0|None|1.0|1|Main Text|88.0

Thorough clinical and metabolic investigations were without specific findings in all cases.. Transient elevations of plasma lactate concentrations were found.. However, plasma lactate was also repeatedly normal in all individuals and brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), performed in subjects DEU and AUT at the age of 17 and 2 years, showed no lactate peaks.<br>. Informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from all affected individuals or their parents in case of minor study participants..

Growth curves were obtained in liquid cultures with SC-His medium by monitoring OD600.. Downregulation of yeast  ILS1  was induced by addition of 50 mg/mL doxycycline.<br>. (A) Expression of the different  IARS  WT and mutant constructs in the TET-ILS1 strain did not show any negative effect on growth.<br>.

Downregulation of yeast  ILS1  was induced by addition of 50 mg/mL doxycycline.<br>.

Without addition of doxycycline, the transformed yeast strains grew like the positive control.. Upon downregulation of the yeast IARS ortholog, no growth rescue was observed in yeast transformed with empty vector (negative control), plasmids encoding the two  IARS  loss-of-function variants c.1252C&gt:T (p. Arg418) (#65269, DEU) and c.760C&gt:T (p. Arg254) (#85880, JPN), or a plasmid encoding the missense variant c.2974A&gt:G (p. Asn992Asp) (#83921, AUT).. An intermediate growth phenotype was obtained by expression of the four missense variants c.235G&gt:C (p. Val79Leu) (not encountered in any proband: the ortholog of that in  IARS  in cattle, which underlies weak calf syndrome), c.3521T&gt:A (p. Ile1174Asn) (#65269, DEU), c.1310C&gt:T (p. Pro437Leu) (#85880, JPN), and c.1109T&gt:G (p. Val370Gly) (#83921, AUT): the last displayed the mildest, but significant, growth impairment (Figure 2).. Hence, each affected human individual is compound heterozygous for an  IARS  loss-of-function allele and an allele with significantly reduced but some remaining functionality, similar to the allele causing weak calf syndrome.. Treatment with zinc appeared beneficial in subject #65269 (DEU), possibly due to zinc deficiency or to zinc dependence of IARS activity, as shown for the  E. coli  ortholog.. Supplementation using a wide range of zinc concentrations did not improve yeast growth, permitting argument that zinc has no direct effect on IARS activity.<br>|20.0|set()|HP:0032320|138.0|Hence, each affected human individual is compound heterozygous for an  IARS  loss-of-function allele and an allele with significantly reduced but some remaining functionality, similar to the allele causing weak calf syndrome.|0.0|i|1.0|1|Main Text|12.0

These include translational control, transcription regulation, signal transduction, and modulation of cell migration, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis.1, 18 IARS also is part of a multi-synthetase complex (MSC), which is organized by nine cytoplasmic ARSs and the three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional proteins AIMP1, AIMP2, and AIMP3.19, 20 Tissue specificity has been speculatively linked to such non-canonical functions or to involvement in the MSC.. Interestingly, deficiencies of LARS and MARS also are known to cause hepatopathy,6, 7 and these enzymes also are part of the MSC.. To propose a role of MSC dysfunction in hepatobiliary disease thus lies near at hand, perhaps through accumulation of mis-folded proteins, with endoplasmic-reticulum stress in consequence, due to incorrect editing of amino acids..
