Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNAs by their cognate amino acid, linking amino acids with the correct nucleotide triplets and ensuring the correct transformation of the genetic code to the protein level.. Editing activities of ARSs further increase translation fidelity by preventing misacylation of tRNAs with non-cognate amino acids.. In mammals, ARSs can be distinguished by their cytoplasmatic or mitochondrial localization, with only two ARS in both compartments (GARS and KARS)..

To evaluate the functional relevance of identified  IARS  variants, we made use of a Tet-Off yeast model.. In the TET-ILS1 strain, expression of  ILS1 , the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ortholog of human  IARS , can be negatively regulated by addition of doxycycline to the growth medium.. The strain shows normal growth under standard conditions (Figure 2).. Reduced expression of  ILS1  resulted in considerable growth impairment: however, this phenotype was fully rescued by expression of the human wild-type  IARS  cDNA (Figure 2, first two lines) providing an in vivo assay to evaluate mutant alleles.. IARS  cDNAs carrying the different variants were cloned into the low-copy vector pYX122 (Novagen) and growth was compared to that of cells transformed with a wild-type copy of  IARS  or with the empty vector.<br>.

Representative data are shown.<br>. Without addition of doxycycline, the transformed yeast strains grew like the positive control.. Upon downregulation of the yeast IARS ortholog, no growth rescue was observed in yeast transformed with empty vector (negative control), plasmids encoding the two  IARS  loss-of-function variants c.1252C&gt:T (p.

An intermediate growth phenotype was obtained by expression of the four missense variants c.235G&gt:C (p.

Hence, each affected human individual is compound heterozygous for an  IARS  loss-of-function allele and an allele with significantly reduced but some remaining functionality, similar to the allele causing weak calf syndrome..

MO specificity was validated by RT-PCR and injection of 5-bp-mismatch MOs (Figure 3 and data not shown).. Upon  iars  downregulation, embryonic development is generally delayed, with embryos exhibiting altered brain configuration and severe shortening of the posterior body axis (Figure 3)..

Lethality rate was decreased to 41% (n = 93) by addition of human  IARS  mRNA, confirming the MO targeting exon 18 specificity and, at the same time, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for  iars  in embryonic development.. As in yeast, zinc treatment did not result in a phenotypic rescue (data not shown).. Overall the experiments performed in this animal model suggest an important role for Iars in embryogenesis.. Downregulation of  iars  causes high lethality, with surviving embryos exhibiting a severe and consistent brain phenotype and a shortening of the body axis reminiscent of the human phenotype.<br>.

Given the ubiquitous presence and vital importance of ARSs in all cells of archae, bacteria, and eukarya, it is remarkable that mutations in ARSs cause considerably distinct clinical pictures with tissue-specific phenotypes in humans.1, 4, 17 Apart from aminoacylation and editing activity, the so-called canonical functions of ARSs, some ARSs exhibit non-canonical activities in vertebrates.. These include translational control, transcription regulation, signal transduction, and modulation of cell migration, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis.1, 18 IARS also is part of a multi-synthetase complex (MSC), which is organized by nine cytoplasmic ARSs and the three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional proteins AIMP1, AIMP2, and AIMP3.19, 20 Tissue specificity has been speculatively linked to such non-canonical functions or to involvement in the MSC.. Interestingly, deficiencies of LARS and MARS also are known to cause hepatopathy,6, 7 and these enzymes also are part of the MSC.. To propose a role of MSC dysfunction in hepatobiliary disease thus lies near at hand, perhaps through accumulation of mis-folded proteins, with endoplasmic-reticulum stress in consequence, due to incorrect editing of amino acids.. An important role for  iars  in zebrafish brain development is consonant with the abnormalities of brain function in the subjects of this study.<br>.

The beneficial effect of zinc supplementation observed in human subjects could not be demonstrated in the yeast or zebrafish models.. Therefore, IARS enzyme activity seems to be independent of zinc levels and the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation is likely compensating secondary zinc deficiency.. However, zinc has been proposed to interact with the active site of IARS and to be required for normal cell growth..
