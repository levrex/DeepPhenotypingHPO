Activities of complex I appeared to be decreased in the three subjects in at least one tissue, whereas activity of complex IV was decreased in one. Thorough clinical and metabolic investigations were without specific findings in all cases. Transient elevations of plasma lactate concentrations were found. However, plasma lactate was also repeatedly normal in all individuals and brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), performed in subjects DEU and AUT at the age of 17 and 2 years, showed no lactate peaks.<br> Informed consent to participate in the study was obtained from all affected individuals or their parents in case of minor study participants. The study was approved by the ethics committees of the University Hospital Heidelberg, the Technische Universitat Munchen, the Jikei University School of Medicine, Chiba Children's Hospital and Saitama Medical University, and the Medical University of Innsbruck. Whole-exome sequencing performed on genomic DNA from individual #65269 (DEU) did not identify likely clinically relevant variants in genes previously associated with the observed clinical phenotype or a mitochondrial disorder.10, 11 A search for homozygous or potentially compound heterozygous rare variants (MAF &lt: 0.1% in 7,000 in-house exomes, 1000 Genomes Study) prioritized the five genes  PROB1 ,  UBR2  (MIM: 609134),  IARS ,  PLXNB3  (MIM: 300214), and  DUSP21  (MIM: 300678). Given the overlap of clinical features of the investigated individual with the phenotypic spectrum of other ARS defects, we considered  IARS  a strong candidate. Results of two independent exome sequencing studies that revealed biallelic  IARS  variants in two unrelated individuals from Austria and Japan with phenotypic features like those in the German boy supplied further evidence for a causal association of biallelic  IARS  variants with the disease presentation. All six identified  IARS  variants were confirmed by Sanger sequencing. Carrier testing confirmed a compound heterozygous state of the  IARS  variants (Figure 1). Except for the variant c.1252C&gt:T, which was detected three times in a heterozygous state, none of the  IARS  variants (c.760C&gt:T, c.1109T&gt:G, c.1310C&gt:T, c.2974A&gt:G, and c.3521T&gt:A) was listed in &gt:120,000 alleles of the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) Server (12/2015). All the missense mutations change evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues (Figure 1) and are accordingly predicted to be damaging (PolyPhen-2 and SIFT). Immunoblotting analysis of fibroblast cell extracts from all three affected individuals showed reduced levels of IARS protein only for subject #65269 (DEU: see Figure S5). Immunostaining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival liver-biopsy material (JPN, AUT) found no marking for IARS in one (JPN) and normal marking in the other (AUT: Figure S6). Four of the six mutations lie in the first half of the gene, in close proximity to the IleRS core domain (Figure 1).<br> Figure 1.

Hence, each affected human individual is compound heterozygous for an  IARS  loss-of-function allele and an allele with significantly reduced but some remaining functionality, similar to the allele causing weak calf syndrome. Treatment with zinc appeared beneficial in subject #65269 (DEU), possibly due to zinc deficiency or to zinc dependence of IARS activity, as shown for the  E. coli  ortholog. Supplementation using a wide range of zinc concentrations did not improve yeast growth, permitting argument that zinc has no direct effect on IARS activity.<br> To gain further insight into the expression pattern of  IARS  and its role for embryonic development, we undertook in situ hybridization and morpholino (MO) knockdown of  iars  in zebrafish. Iars is conserved in zebrafish and shares 74% homology to the human protein. The expression of  iars  is ubiquitous in zebrafish during early embryonic development. It localizes to the somites and developing brain regions after gastrulation, especially in the tectum region of the brain, pineal gland, and hindbrain (Figure 3). To assess Iars function, two splice-blocking MOs specific to  iars  were injected into zebrafish embryos. MO specificity was validated by RT-PCR and injection of 5-bp-mismatch MOs (Figure 3 and data not shown). Upon  iars  d <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0001263

The observed phenotype had a high consistency of about 85% for both MOs. Notably, the knockdown resulted in a concentration-dependent high level of lethality. Embryos injected with 0.5 ng and 1 ng MO targeting exon 32 showed 40% (n = 35) and 80% (n = 95) lethality rates, respectively, while 80% and 85% of embryos died upon injection of the same concentrations of MO targeting exon 18 (n0.5ng = 37 and n1ng = 87). Lethality rate was decreased to 41% (n = 93) by addition of human  IARS  mRNA, confirming the MO targeting exon 18 specificity and, at the same time, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for  iars  in embryonic development. As in yeast, zinc treatment did not result in a phenotypic rescue (data not shown). Overall the experiments performed in this animal model suggest an important role for Iars in embryogenesis.

OXPHOS activities in muscle, liver, and fibroblasts of affected calves (n = 6) were normal compared with controls (n = 3: see Table S2). Thus, OXPHOS dysfunction is not directly linked to mutations in  IARS  in calves. We also determined blood zinc levels in 13 affected calves and 20 healthy calves.

The  ABCB11  variant identified in individual #83921 (AUT) may contribute to greater severity of liver disease, including cholestasis, in him than in the other individuals with compound heterozygous  IARS  mutations and no rare variants in  ABCB11 .<br> An essential role of IARS is underlined by the fact that none of the human subjects have two loss-of-function alleles (the same holds for affected calves, which are homozygous for a single substitution mutation) and by the mainly lethal, severe phenotype of MO knockdown zebrafish.

Given the ubiquitous presence and vital importance of ARSs in all cells of archae, bacteria, and eukarya, it is remarkable that mutations in ARSs cause considerably distinct clinical pictures with tissue-specific phenotypes in humans.1, 4, 17 Apart from aminoacylation and editing activity, the so-called canonical functions of ARSs, some ARSs exhibit non-canonical activities in vertebrates. These include translational control, transcription regulation, signal transduction, and modulation of cell migration, angiogenesis, inflammation, and tumorigenesis.1, 18 IARS also is part of a multi-synthetase complex (MSC), which is organized by nine cytoplasmic ARSs and the three aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase-interacting multifunctional proteins AIMP1, AIMP2, and AIMP3.19, 20 Tissue specificity has been speculatively linked to such non-canonical functions or to involvement in the MSC. Interestingly, deficiencies of LARS and MARS also are known to cause hepatopathy,6, 7 and these enzymes also are part of the MSC.

A simplified gyral pattern is not apparent, however, in the individuals with mutations in  IARS . The beneficial effect of zinc supplementation observed in human subjects could not be demonstrated in the yeast or zebrafish models. Therefore, IARS enzyme activity seems to be independent of zinc levels and the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation is likely compensating secondary zinc deficiency. However, zinc has been proposed to interact with the active site of IARS and to be required for normal cell growth. A role for zinc, especially in ed <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0001392

Precise genetic and clinical phenotyping is crucial for both understanding these diseases and for suspecting and diagnosing them in the clinical setting. This study delineates mutations in  IARS  as underlying a multisystemic disease affecting mainly growth, brain, and liver. For reasons yet to be determined, this disease is associated with zinc deficiency and can be palliated by zinc supplementation.<br> <h2>Acknowledgments</h2> We would like to thank the families for their collaboration.
