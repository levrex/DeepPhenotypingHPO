in wild-type fibroblasts showed altered cell shape and migration, consistent with known roles of cytoplasmic î²-actin. we also demonstrate that actb haploinsufficiency leads to reduced cell

associated with human dds can provide insights into single-gene conditions and their molecular mechanisms.<br>from more than 15,000 individuals who underwent clinical array comparative genomic hybridization for suspected genetic dds at our center, we identified five individuals from four families with 7p22.1 deletions (a; ) and an overlapping phenotype (families iâ€“iv in ; a). actb [mim: ] was the only gene common to all four deletions, leading us to hypothesize that actb haploinsufficiency leads to a distinct clinical syndrome. we ascertained 26 additional individuals from 19 families with likely or definitely pathogenic 7p22.1 deletions that were &lt;3mb and encompassed actb (b; ). next, we interrogated data from 4,293 trios in the deciphering developmental disorders study for de novo nonsense or frameshift variants in all known protein-coding genes on chromosome 7p22.1. we identified two actbâ point mutations, c.1097dupg; p. ser368leufster13 and c.1117a&gt;t; p. lys373ter, in two children (nm_001101.3; enst00000331789) (c; ). finally, weâ identified another individual with a c.329delt; p. leu110argfster10 actb point mutation in the causes study by using the analytical pipeline described previously. the procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national), and proper informed consent was obtained. multiple lines of evidence establish actb loss-of-function mutations as a cause of a pleiotropic clinical syndrome. first, of the genes on human chromosomal region 7p22.1, actb is the only one with a high-probability loss-of-function intolerance (pli) score and low residual variation intolerance score (rvis) as well as a low haploinsufficiency index (hi) (). second, it was the only gene deleted within the minimum critical region in both the discovery and validation cohorts of individuals with 7p22.1 deletions. importantly, we also identified three individual with actb point mutations that, like the deletions, are expected to produce a heterozygous null actb genotype. third, mutations,  <span style="color:red">including all point mutations,</span>  <span style="color:red">were proven to have arisen de novo in 12 individuals.</span>  <span style="color:red">biological parentage was proven in the three individuals who were identified via exome sequencing.</span>  <span style="color:red">in allâ multiplex families,</span>  <span style="color:red">the deletions segregated with the phenotype.</span>  <span style="color:red">fourth,</span>  <span style="color:red">the striking phenotypic convergence in a large cohort ascertained on the basis of genotyping followed by reverse phenotyping rules out possibility of a chance association.</span>  <span style="color:red">collectively,</span>  <span style="color:red">in this cohort of 33 individuals from 25 unrelated families we observed a high frequency of developmental delay,</span>  <span style="color:red">apparent intellectual disability,</span>  <span style="color:red">internal organ malformations (affecting heart,</span>  <span style="color:red">kidneys,</span>  <span style="color:red">spine,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">palate,</span>  <span style="color:red">among others),</span>  <span style="color:red">growth retardation,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">facial dysmorphism (interrupted eyebrows,</span>  <span style="color:red">dense eyelashes,</span>  <span style="color:red">wide nose,</span>  <span style="color:red">wide mouth,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">a prominent chin) (a;</span>  <span style="color:red">).</span>  <span style="color:red">we performed qrt-pcr and</span>  <span style="color:red">measured actb mrna expression in fibroblasts,</span>  <span style="color:red">lymphoblastic cell lines (lcls),</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">fresh blood.</span>  <span style="color:red">expression levels in affected individual-derived cells were consistently lower than in control samples (d).</span> similar findings have been reported in actb mice and in immortalized lymphocytes derived from one individual with a 7p22.1 microdeletion. next, we analyzed î²-actin expression in embryonic day 14 mice, a stage when organogenesis is ongoing; this stage is anatomically similar to the late first trimester of human gestation. î²-actin was prominent in organs affected by the syndrome: cortical neurons and choroid plexus epithelia in the brain; differentiating tubules of the metanephric kidney; and the epicardium, endocardium, and muscle in the outflow tract of the heart (b). notably, it was not expressed uniformly in all embryonic cell types, even from within an organ.î²-actin is essential for a number of cytoplasmic functions, such as regulation of cell shape and migration.<br>we performed an immunoblot and quantified the amount of î²-actin in the cytoplasmic protein fraction of affected individual cells, but no consistent differences in î²-actin expression were observed in affected individual-derived cells versus controls (a). however, affected individual-derived fibroblasts were significantly more circular than controls, although there was no alteration in the average cell size (). their migration was also severely impaired in comparison to that of control fibroblasts (c). importantly, silencing-rna (sirna)-mediated downregulation of actb in control fibroblasts () induced a similar increase in circularity (b) and migration defects (c), proving that the changes in cells with a 7p22.1 deletion were primarily due to actb haploinsufficiency. in the nucleus î²-actin regulates gene expression, cell division, and proliferation. interestingly, in contrast to the cytoplasmic fraction, the nuclear protein fraction showed a reduced amount of î²-actin in cells derived from affected individuals (a). interference with nuclear î²-actin function directly correlates with levels of transcription and cell proliferation. accordingly, we found significantly decreased cellular proliferation in affected individual-derived cells (b and 4c). we examined expression of cell-cycle genes by using rna-seq on samples derived from two controls and two lcls from affected individuals (). in cells from affected individuals, we detected 11-fold increased expression of ccnd1 [mim: ], a key gene that encodes cyclin d1, which should be downregulated for cells to transition from g1 into the s phase (c). this is consistent with the previous observation that î²-actin inhibition leads to arrest in the g1 phase. furthermore, the expression levels of several s- and g2-phase genes were lower in lcls from affected individuals than in control lcls (c). although chromosome 7p22.1 deletions have been described in a small number of affected individuals previously, actb has not been conclusively proven to be theâ underlying gene responsible for the phenotype. we have now described numerous affected families, suggesting that the syndrome caused by loss-of-function actb mutations might have been under-recognized. variation in the phenotype could be due to differences in the sizes of deletion causing loss of additional genes or long-range regulatory dysfunction or due to genetic background or environmental effects.  <span style="color:red">notably,</span>  <span style="color:red">two point mutations in exon 6 are predicted to escape nonsense-mediated decay,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">one in exon 3 is predicted to cause protein truncation.</span>  <span style="color:red">still,</span>  <span style="color:red">it is remarkable that the phenotype of these individuals is similar to that of individuals with actb deletions as opposed to brws [mim:</span>  <span style="color:red">],</span>  <span style="color:red">which suggests that the dosage of full-length î²-actin plays an important role in normal human development.</span>  <span style="color:red">all individuals in our cohort displayed developmental delay and</span>  <span style="color:red">apparent intellectual disability.</span>  <span style="color:red">in several individuals,</span>  <span style="color:red">expressive speech was severely affected.</span>  <span style="color:red">a trusting,</span>  <span style="color:red">empathetic,</span>  <span style="color:red">or sociable personality was reported independently in many individuals.</span>  <span style="color:red">some were reported to have

style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">social behavior.</span>  <span style="color:red">this could explain the developmental and</span>  <span style="color:red">behavioral phenotype of affected individuals.</span>  <span style="color:red">among ten individuals who were investigated with brain magnetic-resonance imaging,</span>  <span style="color:red">eight (80%) were detected to

style="color:red">major renal anomalies were detected in 7 out of 19 (36.8%) individuals whose renal ultrasound examination or post-mortem reports were available.</span>  <span style="color:red">these included four individuals with horseshoe kidneys,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">one each with unilateral renal agenesis,</span>  <span style="color:red">pelvic

<span style="color:red">cryptorchidism.</span>  <span style="color:red">spinal and</span>  <span style="color:red">palatal anomalies were also detected in six and</span>  <span style="color:red">four individuals,</span>  <span style="color:red">respectively.</span>  <span style="color:red">collectively,</span>  <span style="color:red">our data show that internal organ malformations,</span>  <span style="color:red">particularly in the heart and</span>  <span style="color:red">kidneys,</span>  <span style="color:red">are much more frequent in individuals with loss-of-function actb mutations than in the general population.<br>a role of î²-actin in morphogenesis is supported by our detection of this protein in the developing heart and</span>  <span style="color:red">kidney epithelia in mice.</span>  <span style="color:red">furthermore,</span> in cells from affected individuals, we showed altered cellular morphology, migration, and proliferation, which are all key developmental processes. although growth parameters were not available for all affected individuals, we noted growth retardation in 13 individuals. this could be related to î²-actinâ€™s role in cell growth and  <span style="color:red">proliferation,</span>  <span style="color:red">which we also observed in the affected individualâ€™s cells.</span>  <span style="color:red">the individuals described here have overlapping dysmorphism with interrupted wavy eyebrows,</span>  <span style="color:red">dense eyelashes,</span>  <span style="color:red">hypertelorism,</span>  <span style="color:red">a wide nose,</span>  <span style="color:red">a wide mouth,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">a prominent chin.</span>  <span style="color:red">this is distinct from the typical facial dysmorphism of brws,</span>  <span style="color:red">although we did notice some overlapping features,</span>  <span style="color:red">such as a wide mouth and</span>  <span style="color:red">hypertelorism,</span>  <span style="color:red">inâ both groups.</span> none of our individuals were detected to have agyria/pachygyria or coloboma, which are frequent in brws. this further emphasizes that actb loss-of-function mutations cause a specific syndrome distinct from brws. the facial characteristics of individual described here resemble those in several chromatin remodeling disorders, such as the interrupted eyebrows in kabuki syndrome [mim: and ] and the typical lip configuration and large mouth seen in kbg syndrome [mim: ]. î²-actin is a part of chromatin remodeling complexes such as swr1 and swi-snf, and mutations in its components cause floating-harbour syndrome [mim: ] and coffin-siris syndrome [mim: ], respectively. of note, we detected decreased amounts of nuclear î²-actin, along with dysregulated gene expression, in cells of affected individuals. the role of nuclear î²-actin has been the subject of recent intense research, and our results highlight the importance of its correct dosage in human development. in summary, we have described, in 33 individuals, aâ pleiotropic disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of actb, which encodes for the most abundant eukaryotic cytoplasmic protein, î²-actin. although we have shown some of the consequences of reduced dosage of actb inâ vitro, further studies will be required to if we are to understand the mechanisms behind the phenotypes resulting from loss-of-function actb mutations. notably, the mechanisms linking actb missense mutations with brws also remain unknown. the partial overlap of phenotypes of individuals with brws and actb loss-of-function mutations suggest that perhaps the underlying mechanism of brws is not just, as postulated, gain of function, but might also include some effects resulting from loss-of-function or dominant-negative effects. researchers are increasingly recognizing that different mutations in the same gene can have different underlying genetic effects and thus can result in different phenotypes. interestingly, missense actg1 [mim: ] (encoding the only other ubiquitously expressed actin,  <span style="color:red">î³-actin) mutations also result in brws.</span>  <span style="color:red">however,</span>  <span style="color:red">we did not observe any distinct phenotype that could be attributed to actg1 deletions (data not presented).</span>  <span style="color:red">of note,</span>  <span style="color:red">the pli score for actg1 is 0.22,</span>  <span style="color:red">which decreases the likelihood that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in this gene are a cause of an early-onset human disorder.</span>  <span style="color:red">hence,</span>  <span style="color:red">these observations support overlapping but</span>  <span style="color:red">distinct cellular roles for the two ubiquitously expressed î²- and</span>  <span style="color:red">î³-actins.</span>  <span style="color:red">overall,</span>  <span style="color:red">our linked biology studies suggest that a critically reduced amount of î²-actin alters cell shape,</span>  <span style="color:red">migration,</span>  <span style="color:red">proliferation,</span> and gene expression to the detriment of brain, heart, and kidney development. we are thankful to all individual and their families for participating in the
