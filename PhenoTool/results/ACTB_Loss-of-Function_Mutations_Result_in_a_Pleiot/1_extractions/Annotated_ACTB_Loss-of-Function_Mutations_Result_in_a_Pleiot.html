affected individuals,</span>  <span style="color:red">we noted growth retardation in 13 individuals.</span>  <span style="color:red">this could be related to -actins role in cell growth and</span>  <span style="color:red">proliferation,</span>  <span style="color:red">which we also observed in the affected individuals cells.<div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib17-d7663730e2038"></div></div></div><div class="section-paragraph">the individuals described here have overlapping dysmorphism with interrupted wavy eyebrows,</span>  <span style="color:red">dense eyelashes,</span>  <span style="color:red">hypertelorism,</span>  <span style="color:red">a wide nose,</span>  <span style="color:red">a wide mouth,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">a prominent chin.</span>  <span style="color:red">this is distinct from the typical facial dysmorphism of brws,</span>  <span style="color:red">although we did notice some overlapping features,</span>  <span style="color:red">such as a wide mouth and</span> hypertelorism, inboth groups. none of our individuals were detected to have agyria/pachygyria or coloboma, which are frequent in brws.<div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib30-d7663730e2043"></div></div> <div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib31-d7663730e2043"></div></div> this further emphasizes that <em>actb</em> loss-of-function mutations cause a specific syndrome distinct from brws.</div><div class="section-paragraph">the facial characteristics of individual described here resemble those in several chromatin remodeling disorders, such as the interrupted eyebrows in kabuki syndrome [mim: and ]<div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib32-d7663730e2058"></div></div> <div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib33-d7663730e2058"></div></div> and the typical lip configuration and large mouth seen in kbg syndrome [mim: ]. -actin is a part of chromatin remodeling complexes such as swr1 and swi-snf,<div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib18-d7663730e2065"></div></div> and mutations in its components cause floating-harbour syndrome [mim: ]<div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib34-d7663730e2073"></div></div> and coffin-siris syndrome [mim: ],<div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib35-d7663730e2080"></div></div> respectively. of note, we detected decreased amounts of nuclear -actin, along with dysregulated gene expression, in cells of affected individuals. the role of nuclear -actin has been the subject of recent intense research,<div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib36-d7663730e2084"></div></div> <div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib37-d7663730e2084"></div></div> and our results highlight the importance of its correct dosage in human development.</div><div class="section-paragraph">in summary, we have described, in 33 individuals, apleiotropic disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of <em>actb</em>, which encodes for the most abundant eukaryotic cytoplasmic protein, -actin. although we have shown some of the consequences of reduced dosage of <em>actb invitro</em>,  <span style="color:red">further studies will be required to if we are to understand the mechanisms behind the phenotypes resulting from loss-of-function <em>actb</em> mutations.</span>  <span style="color:red">notably,</span>  <span style="color:red">the mechanisms linking <em>actb</em> missense mutations withbaraitser-winter syndromealso remain unknown.</span>  <span style="color:red">the partial overlap of phenotypes of individuals withbaraitser-winter syndromeand <em>actb</em> loss-of-function mutations suggest that perhaps the underlying mechanism ofbaraitser-winter syndromeis not just,</span>  <span style="color:red">as postulated,</span>  <span style="color:red">gain of function,</span>  <span style="color:red">but</span>  <span style="color:red">might also include some effects resulting from loss-of-function or dominant-negative effects.</span>  <span style="color:red">researchers are increasingly recognizing that different mutations in the same gene can have different underlying genetic effects and</span>  <span style="color:red">thus can result in different phenotypes.<div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib38-d7663730e2106"></div></div> interestingly,</span>  <span style="color:red">missense <em>actg1</em> [mim:</span>  <span style="color:red">] (encoding the only other ubiquitously expressed actin,</span>  <span style="color:red">-actin) mutations also result in brws.<div class="dropblock reference-citations"><div class="dropblock__holder" data-db-target-of="bib22-d7663730e2116"></div></div> however,</span>  <span style="color:red">we did not observe any distinct phenotype that could be attributed to <em>actg1</em> deletions (data not presented).</span>  <span style="color:red">of note,</span>  <span style="color:red">the pli score for <em>actg1</em> is 0.22,</span>  <span style="color:red">which decreases the likelihood that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in this gene are a cause of an early-onset human disorder.</span>  <span style="color:red">hence,</span>  <span style="color:red">these observations support overlapping but</span> distinct cellular roles for the two ubiquitously expressed - and -actins. overall, our linked biology studies suggest that a critically reduced amount of -actin alters cell shape, migration, proliferation, and gene expression to the detriment of brain, heart, and kidney development.</div></section><section><h2 class="top"
