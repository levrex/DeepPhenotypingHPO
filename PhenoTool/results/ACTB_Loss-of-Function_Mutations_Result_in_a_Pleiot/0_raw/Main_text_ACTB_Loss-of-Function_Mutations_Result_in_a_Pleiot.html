In humans, postulated gain-of-function missense mutations cause Baraitser-Winter syndrome (BRWS), characterized by intellectual disability, cortical malformations, coloboma, sensorineural deafness, and typical facial features. To date, the consequences of loss-of-function ACTB mutations have not been proven conclusively. We describe heterozygous ACTB deletions and nonsense and frameshift mutations in 33 individuals with developmental delay, apparent intellectual disability, increased frequency of internal organ malformations (including those of the heart and the renal tract), growth retardation, and a recognizable facial gestalt (interrupted wavy eyebrows, dense eyelashes, wide nose, wide mouth, and a prominent chin) that is distinct from characteristics of individuals with BRWS. Strikingly, this spectrum overlaps with that of several chromatin-remodeling developmental disorders. In wild-type mouse embryos, β-actin expression was prominent in the kidney, heart, and brain. ACTB mRNA expression levels in lymphoblastic lines and fibroblasts derived from affected individuals were decreased in comparison to those in control cells. Fibroblasts derived from an affected individual and ACTB siRNA knockdown in wild-type fibroblasts showed altered cell shape and migration, consistent with known roles of cytoplasmic β-actin. We also demonstrate that ACTB haploinsufficiency leads to reduced cell proliferation, altered expression of cell-cycle genes, and decreased amounts of nuclear, but not cytoplasmic, β-actin. In conclusion, we show that heterozygous loss-of-function ACTB mutations cause a distinct pleiotropic malformation syndrome with intellectual disability. Our biological studies suggest that a critically reduced amount of this protein alters cell shape, migration, proliferation, and gene expression to the detriment of brain, heart, and kidney development. Developmental disorders (DDs) are thought to affect 2%–5% of individuals and are genetically heterogeneous. They range from isolated internal organ malformations and intellectual disability to complex syndromic presentations. In developed economies, congenital malformations are one of the leading causes of death among children and account for almost 25% of neonatal deaths. DDs constitute a large proportion of the life-long global health burden in terms of medical expenditure, hospitalizations, and mortality. Accurate diagnosis and better mechanistic understanding are key to improving medical management. Rare copy-number variations associated with human DDs can provide insights into single-gene conditions and their molecular mechanisms.<br>From more than 15,000 individuals who underwent clinical array comparative genomic hybridization for suspected genetic DDs at our center, we identified five individuals from four families with 7p22.1 deletions (A; ) and an overlapping phenotype (families I–IV in ; A). ACTB [MIM: ] was the only gene common to all four deletions, leading us to hypothesize that ACTB haploinsufficiency leads to a distinct clinical syndrome. We ascertained 26 additional individuals from 19 families with likely or definitely pathogenic 7p22.1 deletions that were &lt;3Mb and encompassed ACTB (B; ). Next, we interrogated data from 4,293 trios in the Deciphering Developmental Disorders study for de novo nonsense or frameshift variants in all known protein-coding genes on chromosome 7p22.1. We identified two ACTB point mutations, c.1097dupG; p. Ser368LeufsTer13 and c.1117A&gt;T; p. Lys373Ter, in two children (NM_001101.3; ENST00000331789) (C; ). Finally, we identified another individual with a c.329delT; p. Leu110ArgfsTer10 ACTB point mutation in the CAUSES Study by using the analytical pipeline described previously. The procedures followed were in accordance with the ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation (institutional and national), and proper informed consent was obtained. Multiple lines of evidence establish ACTB loss-of-function mutations as a cause of a pleiotropic clinical syndrome. First, of the genes on human chromosomal region 7p22.1, ACTB is the only one with a high-probability loss-of-function intolerance (pLI) score and low residual variation intolerance score (RVIS) as well as a low haploinsufficiency index (HI) (). Second, it was the only gene deleted within the minimum critical region in both the discovery and validation cohorts of individuals with 7p22.1 deletions. Importantly, we also identified three individual with ACTB point mutations that, like the deletions, are expected to produce a heterozygous null ACTB genotype. Third, mutations, including all point mutations, were proven to have arisen de novo in 12 individuals. Biological parentage was proven in the three individuals who were identified via exome sequencing. In all multiplex families, the deletions segregated with the phenotype. Fourth, the striking phenotypic convergence in a large cohort ascertained on the basis of genotyping followed by reverse phenotyping rules out possibility of a chance association. Collectively, in this cohort of 33 individuals from 25 unrelated families we observed a high frequency of developmental delay, apparent intellectual disability, internal organ malformations (affecting heart, kidneys, spine, and palate, among others), growth retardation, and facial dysmorphism (interrupted eyebrows, dense eyelashes, wide nose, wide mouth, and a prominent chin) (A; ). We performed qRT-PCR and measured ACTB mRNA expression in fibroblasts, lymphoblastic cell lines (LCLs), and fresh blood. Expression levels in affected individual-derived cells were consistently lower than in control samples (D). Similar findings have been reported in Actb mice and in immortalized lymphocytes derived from one individual with a 7p22.1 microdeletion. Next, we analyzed β-actin expression in embryonic day 14 mice, a stage when organogenesis is ongoing; this stage is anatomically similar to the late first trimester of human gestation. β-actin was prominent in organs affected by the syndrome: cortical neurons and choroid plexus epithelia in the brain; differentiating tubules of the metanephric kidney; and the epicardium, endocardium, and muscle in the outflow tract of the heart (B). Notably, it was not expressed uniformly in all embryonic cell types, even from within an organ.β-actin is essential for a number of cytoplasmic functions, such as regulation of cell shape and migration.<br>We performed an immunoblot and quantified the amount of β-actin in the cytoplasmic protein fraction of affected individual cells, but no consistent differences in β-actin expression were observed in affected individual-derived cells versus controls (A). However, affected individual-derived fibroblasts were significantly more circular than controls, although there was no alteration in the average cell size (). Their migration was also severely impaired in comparison to that of control fibroblasts (C). Importantly, silencing-RNA (siRNA)-mediated downregulation of ACTB in control fibroblasts () induced a similar increase in circularity (B) and migration defects (C), proving that the changes in cells with a 7p22.1 deletion were primarily due to ACTB haploinsufficiency. In the nucleus β-actin regulates gene expression, cell division, and proliferation.  Interestingly, in contrast to the cytoplasmic fraction, the nuclear protein fraction showed a reduced amount of β-actin in cells derived from affected individuals (A). Interference with nuclear β-actin function directly correlates with levels of transcription and cell proliferation. Accordingly, we found significantly decreased cellular proliferation in affected individual-derived cells (B and 4C). We examined expression of cell-cycle genes by using RNA-Seq on samples derived from two controls and two LCLs from affected individuals (). In cells from affected individuals, we detected 11-fold increased expression of CCND1 [MIM: ], a key gene that encodes cyclin D1, which should be downregulated for cells to transition from G1 into the S phase (C). This is consistent with the previous observation that β-actin inhibition leads to arrest in the G1 phase. Furthermore, the expression levels of several S- and G2-phase genes were lower in LCLs from affected individuals than in control LCLs (C). Although chromosome 7p22.1 deletions have been described in a small number of affected individuals previously, ACTB has not been conclusively proven to be the underlying gene responsible for the phenotype. We have now described numerous affected families, suggesting that the syndrome caused by loss-of-function ACTB mutations might have been under-recognized. Variation in the phenotype could be due to differences in the sizes of deletion causing loss of additional genes or long-range regulatory dysfunction or due to genetic background or environmental effects. Notably, two point mutations in exon 6 are predicted to escape nonsense-mediated decay, and one in exon 3 is predicted to cause protein truncation. Still, it is remarkable that the phenotype of these individuals is similar to that of individuals with ACTB deletions as opposed to BRWS [MIM: ], which suggests that the dosage of full-length β-actin plays an important role in normal human development. All individuals in our cohort displayed developmental delay and apparent intellectual disability. In several individuals, expressive speech was severely affected. A trusting, empathetic, or sociable personality was reported independently in many individuals. Some were reported to have autism-spectrum or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders. Actin filaments are a major structural component of synapses and are critical for synaptic plasticity, which directly influences neurodevelopment, cognitive performance, and social behavior.  This could explain the developmental and behavioral phenotype of affected individuals. Among ten individuals who were investigated with brain magnetic-resonance imaging, eight (80%) were detected to have some abnormality, including gray-matter heterotopias in two individuals (). This is consistent with neuronal migration defects, prominent expression of β-actin in cortical neurons of developing mice, and our findings of defects in cellular migration in cells from affected individuals. Other neuroradiological features included cortical atrophy, cerebral white-matter hyperintensities, a thin corpus callosum, a septum pellucidum cyst, megacisterna magna, ventricular enlargement, and hydrocephalus. Seizures were reported in a minor subset of individuals, and one individual had dystonia. Delayed-onset generalized dystonia has been reported in monozygotic twins with an ACTB p. Arg183Trp mutation. Congenital cardiac anomalies such as ventricular and atrial septal defects, sub-aortic stenosis, tortuous arch, total anomalous pulmonary venous drainage, patent ductus arteriosus, tricuspid valve dysplasia, and ventricular dilatation were observed in 11 out of 22 (50%) individuals who were investigated by echocardiogram or post-mortem examination (). Major renal anomalies were detected in 7 out of 19 (36.8%) individuals whose renal ultrasound examination or post-mortem reports were available. These included four individuals with horseshoe kidneys, and one each with unilateral renal agenesis, pelvic kidney, and kidney cysts (). Vesicouretric reflux and hydronephrosis were also seen in some individuals. Those males, who lacked overt renal malformations, still had a high frequency of anomalies such as inguinal hernias, hypospadias, micropenis, urethral cyst and cryptorchidism. Spinal and palatal anomalies were also detected in six and four individuals, respectively. Collectively, our data show that internal organ malformations, particularly in the heart and kidneys, are much more frequent in individuals with loss-of-function ACTB mutations than in the general population.<br>A role of β-actin in morphogenesis is supported by our detection of this protein in the developing heart and kidney epithelia in mice. Furthermore, in cells from affected individuals, we showed altered cellular morphology, migration, and proliferation, which are all key developmental processes. Although growth parameters were not available for all affected individuals, we noted growth retardation in 13 individuals. This could be related to β-actin’s role in cell growth and proliferation, which we also observed in the affected individual’s cells. The individuals described here have overlapping dysmorphism with interrupted wavy eyebrows, dense eyelashes, hypertelorism, a wide nose, a wide mouth, and a prominent chin. This is distinct from the typical facial dysmorphism of BRWS, although we did notice some overlapping features, such as a wide mouth and hypertelorism, in both groups. None of our individuals were detected to have agyria/pachygyria or coloboma, which are frequent in BRWS.  This further emphasizes that ACTB loss-of-function mutations cause a specific syndrome distinct from BRWS. The facial characteristics of individual described here resemble those in several chromatin remodeling disorders, such as the interrupted eyebrows in Kabuki syndrome [MIM:  and ]  and the typical lip configuration and large mouth seen in KBG syndrome [MIM: ]. β-actin is a part of chromatin remodeling complexes such as SWR1 and SWI-SNF, and mutations in its components cause Floating-Harbour syndrome [MIM: ] and Coffin-Siris syndrome [MIM: ], respectively. Of note, we detected decreased amounts of nuclear β-actin, along with dysregulated gene expression, in cells of affected individuals. The role of nuclear β-actin has been the subject of recent intense research,  and our results highlight the importance of its correct dosage in human development. In summary, we have described, in 33 individuals, a pleiotropic disorder caused by haploinsufficiency of ACTB, which encodes for the most abundant eukaryotic cytoplasmic protein, β-actin. Although we have shown some of the consequences of reduced dosage of ACTB in vitro, further studies will be required to if we are to understand the mechanisms behind the phenotypes resulting from loss-of-function ACTB mutations. Notably, the mechanisms linking ACTB missense mutations with BRWS also remain unknown. The partial overlap of phenotypes of individuals with BRWS and ACTB loss-of-function mutations suggest that perhaps the underlying mechanism of BRWS is not just, as postulated, gain of function, but might also include some effects resulting from loss-of-function or dominant-negative effects. Researchers are increasingly recognizing that different mutations in the same gene can have different underlying genetic effects and thus can result in different phenotypes. Interestingly, missense ACTG1 [MIM: ] (encoding the only other ubiquitously expressed actin, γ-actin) mutations also result in BRWS. However, we did not observe any distinct phenotype that could be attributed to ACTG1 deletions (data not presented). Of note, the pLI score for ACTG1 is 0.22, which decreases the likelihood that heterozygous loss-of-function mutations in this gene are a cause of an early-onset human disorder. Hence, these observations support overlapping but distinct cellular roles for the two ubiquitously expressed β- and γ-actins. Overall, our linked biology studies suggest that a critically reduced amount of β-actin alters cell shape, migration, proliferation, and gene expression to the detriment of brain, heart, and kidney development.
