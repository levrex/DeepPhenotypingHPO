Whole Genome Sequencing revealed a novel pathogenic missense variant (c.290A &gt: G) in the cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase gene, leading to an amino acid substitution (p. Asp97Gly).

SECTION: OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP" ></span>  His symptoms have recently improved with the addition of subcutaneous methotrexate. Vedolizumab infusions are being considered as a further steroid-sparing immunomodulator. Informed written consent was obtained to report on this case from the child's parents.<br> <h5>DISCUSSION</h5> This is the first report of a homozygous variant in cytosolic IARS associated with refractory very early-onset IBD. The fact that this variant is novel, is predicted to result in an amino acid substitution from aspartate to glycine at a highly conserved residue, and segregates with the phenotype in the family, indicates that it is disease causing. Supportive evidence from additional cases and functional enzyme assays would be helpful in definitively confirming the role of the  gene in very early-onset IBD. Assays are unfortunately not currently available. This case report will hopefully lead to additional patients with very early-onset IBD due to variants in the  gene being reported by other clinicians.<br> ARSs may be associated with T-cell dysfunction as seen in our patient, but the lack of improvement with most immunosuppressant drugs suggests that other inflammatory pathways are involved. <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0005435

SECTION: DISCUSSION" ></span>  The high IL-10 level is in keeping with an ineffectual compensatory Treg response rather than a defect in this pathway. There is some suggestion that sirolimus, which blocks mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 may ameliorate the disease, but use of sirolimus in our patient made no difference to his clinical course.<br> Maintaining optimal zinc levels may also help optimize aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity, but our patient had normal plasma zinc concentrations and zinc supplements did not help ameliorate his IBD. It is possible that there are defects in cell turnover and resultant barrier dysfunction of gut mucosa leading to microbe-induced inflammation particularly in the colon. <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0002037

SECTION: DISCUSSION" ></span>  Broad-spectrum antibiotics may help for severe exacerbations.<br> <h5>CONCLUSION</h5> This case report provides evidence for a novel monogenic cause of IBD that should be considered, particularly in patients with very early-onset, poor response to treatment and a history of neonatal hepatitis.<br> <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0012115
