Repeated endoscopies showed persistent pancolitis, which was refractory to mesalazine, corticosteroids, azathioprine, sirolimus and anti-TNF (adalimumab) therapy, but has improved recently with subcutaneous methotrexate.. Whole Genome Sequencing revealed a novel pathogenic missense variant (c.290A &gt: G) in the cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase gene, leading to an amino acid substitution (p. Asp97Gly).. Pathogenic variants in other genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) () were excluded..

This case report provides evidence for a novel monogenic cause of inflammatory bowel disease that should be considered, particularly in patients with very early-onset, poor response to treatment and a history of neonatal hepatitis.<br><h5>INTRODUCTION</h5>. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases/ligases (ARSs) are a group of 20 ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved enzymes involved in attaching each specific amino acid to a tRNA to promote protein synthesis.. ARS deficiencies localized to the mitochondria have been known for 40 years and classically present with lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, failure to thrive and global developmental delay.. Clinical features of cytosolic ARS deficiency are more variable.. In 2016, three unrelated individuals harboring compound homozygous variants in cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IARS) [p.(Arg418)(Ile1174Asn), p.(Arg254)(Pro437Leu) and p.(Val370Gly)(Asn992Asp) (MIM: 600709)] were reported.|12.0|set()|HP:0001941|45.0|ARS deficiencies localized to the mitochondria have been known for 40 years and classically present with lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, failure to thrive and global developmental delay.|['Acidosis']|0.0|None|0.0|1.0|INTRODUCTION|8.0
