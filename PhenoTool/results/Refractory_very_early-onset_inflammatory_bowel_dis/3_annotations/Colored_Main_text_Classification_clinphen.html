HD: Healthy donor: IARS: Isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase.<br>In view of the very early-onset of the disease and its poor response to immunosuppres-sive medication, an underlying genetic cause was considered. Whole genome sequencing performed as part of the United Kingdom 100000 Genome Project revealed a homozygous c.290A &gt: G, p.(Asp97Gly) variant in cytosolic IARS (encoded by IARS1, NM_013417). Parents were both heterozygous as were two unaffected siblings with the other unaffected sibling wild type. The variant was absent in the gnomAD database of about 140000 controls and scored by  predictors (MutationTaster 0.99: CADD score 32) to be pathogenic. The aspartic acid residue at this position is conserved to  and the variant lies in the IleRS core domain, where other disease causing variants have been identified. Variants in other genes associated with IBD () were screened and no potentially pathogenic variants were found.<br> Immune phenotyping was determined by flow cytometry. Mucosal-associated invariant T-cells cell and natural killer cell frequencies were reduced, comprising &lt: 0.2 and 1% of lymphocytes, respectively (range: 1%-15%). Greater than 60% of the patient's CD4 and CD8 T cells were of a naive phenotype, reflecting the young age of the patient. T-cells, total B-cells as well as B-cell subsets (transitional, naive, memory, class switching) were within normal range. Release of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg pathway cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, TNFa and IFNb) that may be deranged in IBD were assayed by cytometric bead array (Becton Dickinson) after 5-d stimulation of purified memory CD4+ T cells with anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies. Secretion of some inflammatory (IL-2, IL-5, IL-13, IL-9) and immune regulatory (IL-10) cytokines by the patient memory CD4 T-cells was markedly elevated, while IL-17A, IL-17F, IFNb were lower and TNFa not significantly different compared to healthy donors (Figure 1C).<br> <h5>FINAL DIAGNOSIS</h5> Transient neo <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0012115

Recent treatment with subcutaneous methotrexate has led to reduction in his stool frequency to 4 - 5 stools/d with no blood or mucous.<br> <h5>OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP</h5> Nine-year-old boy with chronic IBD (ten bloody watery stools/day and abdominal pain) despite normal plasma zinc concentration and most standard immune modulatory therapy. His symptoms have recently improved with the addition of subcutaneous methotrexate. Vedolizumab infusions are being considered as a further steroid-sparing immunomodulator. Informed written consent was obtained to report on this case from the child's parents.<br> <h5>DISCUSSION</h5> This is the first report of a homozygous variant in cytosolic IARS associated with refractory very early-onset IBD. The fact that this variant is novel, is predicted to result in an amino acid substitution from aspartate to glycine at a highly conserved residue, and segregates with the phenotype in the family, indicates that it is disease causing. Supportive evidence from additional cases and functional enzyme assays would be helpful in definitively confirming the role of the  gene in very early-onset IBD. Assays are unfortunately not currently available. This case report will hopefully lead to additional patients with very early-onset IBD due to variants in the  gene being reported by other clinicians.<br> ARSs may be associated with T-cell dysfunction as seen in our patient, but the lack of improvement with most immunosuppressant drugs suggests that other inflammatory pathways are involved. The high IL-10 level is in keeping with an ineffectual compensatory Treg response rather than a defect in this pathway. There is some suggestion that sirolimus, which blocks mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 may ameliorate the disease, but use of sirolimus in our patient made no difference to his clinical course.<br> Maintaining optimal zinc levels may also help optimize aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity, but our patient had normal plasma zinc concentrations and zinc supplements did not help ameliorate his IBD. It is possible that there are defects in cell turnover and resultant barrier dysfunction of gut mucosa leading to microbe-induced inflammation particularly in the colon. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may help for severe exacerbations.<br> <h5>CONCLUSION</h5> This case report provides eviden <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0012115
