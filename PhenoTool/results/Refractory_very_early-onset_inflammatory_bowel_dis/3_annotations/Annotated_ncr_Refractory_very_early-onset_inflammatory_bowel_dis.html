<h5>BACKGROUND</h5>Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases/ligases (ARSs) are highly conserved enzymes involved in attaching amino acids to tRNA promoting protein synthesis. Although deficiencies of ARSs localized to the mitochondria classically present with neuropathology, the clinical features of cytosolic ARS deficiencies are more variable. They have previously been associated with neonatal  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0012115

CONF: 0.9595801" >bloody</span>  motions a day. Repeated endoscopies showed persistent pancolitis, which was refractory to mesalazine, corticosteroids, azathioprine, sirolimus and anti-TNF (adalimumab) therapy, but has improved recently with subcutaneous methotrexate. Whole Genome Sequencing revealed a novel pathogenic missense variant (c.290A &gt; G) in the cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase gene, leading to an amino acid substitution (p. Asp97Gly). Pathogenic variants in other genes associated with  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0002037
CONF: 0.9901862" >inflammatory bowel disease</span>  (IBD) () were excluded. Cytokine assays demonstrated markedly elevated IL-2, IL-5, IL-13, IL-9 and IL-10 by the patients CD4 T-cells, while IL-17A, IL-17F, IFN were lower, and TNF not significantly different when compared to healthy controls. <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>This case report provides evidence that recessive mutations in cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase are a novel monogenic cause of IBD, which should be considered, particularly in infants and children with a history of neonatal  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0012115

CONF: 0.9898116" >granuloma</span>  to suggest Crohns disease. In view of the very early-onset of the disease and its poor response to immunosuppres-sive medication, an underlying genetic cause was considered. Whole genome sequencing performed as part of the United Kingdom 100000 Genome Project revealed a homozygous c.290A &gt; G, p.(Asp97Gly) variant in cytosolic IARS (encoded by IARS1, NM_013417). Parents were both heterozygous as were two unaffected siblings with the other unaffected sibling wild type. The variant was absent in the gnomAD database of about 140000 controls and scored by  predictors (MutationTaster 0.99; CADD score 32) to be pathogenic. The aspartic acid residue at this position is conserved to  and the variant lies in the IleRS core domain, where other disease causing variants have been identified. Variants in other genes associated with IBD () were screened and no potentially pathogenic variants were found. Immune phenotyping was determined by flow cytometry. Mucosal-associated invariant T-cells cell and natural killer cell frequencies were reduced, comprising &lt; 0.2 and 1% of  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0004332
CONF: 0.83618915" >lymphocytes</span> , respectively (range: 1%-15%). Greater than 60% of the patients CD4 and CD8 T cells were of a naive phenotype, reflecting the young age of the patient. T-cells, total B-cells as well as B-cell subsets (transitional, naive, memory, class switching) were within normal range. Release of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg pathway cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, TNF and IFN) that may be deranged in IBD were assayed by cytometric bead array (Becton Dickinson) after 5-d stimulation of purified  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0002354
CONF: 0.81613743" >memory CD</span> 4+ T cells with anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies. Secretion of some inflammatory (IL-2, IL-5, IL-13, IL-9) and immune regulatory (IL-10) cytokines by the patient  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0002354
CONF: 0.81613743" >memory CD</span> 4 T-cells was markedly elevated, while IL-17A, IL-17F, IFN were lower and TNF not significantly different compared to healthy donors (Figure ).<h5>FINAL DIAGNOSIS</h5>Transient neonatal  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0012115
CONF: 0.9798366" >hepatitis</span>  and refractory very early-onset IBD due to cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase.<h5>TREATMENT</h5>His IBD was refractory to additional zinc supplementation, as well as immune modulation with mesalazine, corticosteroids, azathioprine, sirolimus and anti-TNF therapy (adalimumab). Recent treatment with subcutaneous methotrexate has led to reduction in his stool frequency to 4  5 stools/d with no blood or mucous.<h5>OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP</h5>Nine-year-old boy with chronic IBD (ten  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0025085
CONF: 0.96083343" >bloody watery</span>  stools/day and  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0002027
CONF: 0.9941204" >abdominal pain</span> ) despite normal plasma zinc concentration and most standard immune modulatory therapy. His symptoms have recently improved with the addition of subcutaneous methotrexate. Vedolizumab infusions are being considered as a further steroid-sparing immunomodulator. Informed written consent was obtained to report on this case from the childs parents.<h5>DISCUSSION</h5>This is the first report of a homozygous variant in cytosolic IARS associated with refractory very early-onset IBD. The fact that this variant is novel, is predicted to result in an amino acid substitution from aspartate to glycine at a highly conserved residue, and segregates with the phenotype in the family, indicates that it is disease causing. Supportive evidence from additional cases and functional enzyme assays would be helpful in definitively confirming the role of the  gene in very early-onset IBD. Assays are unfortunately not currently available. This case report will hopefully lead to additional patients with very early-onset IBD due to variants in the  gene being reported by other clinicians. ARSs may be associated with  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0005435
CONF: 0.99247205" >T-cell dysfunction</span>  as seen in our patient, but the lack of improvement with most immunosuppressant drugs suggests that other inflammatory pathways are involved. The high IL-10 level is in keeping with an ineffectual compensatory Treg response rather than a defect in this pathway. There is some suggestion that sirolimus, which blocks mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 may ameliorate the disease, but use of sirolimus in our patient made no difference to his clinical course. Maintaining optimal zinc levels may also help optimize aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity, but our patient had normal plasma zinc concentrations and zinc supplements did not help ameliorate his IBD. It is possible that there are defects in cell turnover and resultant barrier dysfunction of gut mucosa leading to microbe-induced  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0002037

Broad-spectrum antibiotics may help for severe exacerbations.<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>This case report provides evidence for a novel monogenic cause of IBD that should be considered, particularly in patients with very early-onset, poor response to treatment and a history of neonatal  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0012115
