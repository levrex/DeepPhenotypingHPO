In 2016, three unrelated individuals harboring compound homozygous variants in cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IARS) [p.(Arg418)(Ile1174Asn), p.(Arg254)(Pro437Leu) and p.(Val370Gly)(Asn992Asp) (MIM: 600709)] were reported.. The patients suffered growth and developmental delay, sensorineural hearing loss, muscular hypotonia, diabetes mellitus, hepatic dysfunction with steatosis and fibrosis, and zinc deficiency.. A further individual with compound heterozygous for the missense substitutions p.(Arg739Cys)(Phe556Ser) with microcephaly, growth and developmental delay and neonatal cholestasis was described in 2017 and a seven year old boy compound heterozygous for p.(Gln671fs)(Thr69Ile) has also been reported with hepatopathy, hypotonia, intellectual disability and growth retardation.. Here, we present a child with cytosolic IARS deficiency, whose main clinical feature was refractory inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), hitherto not previously described in other patients with IARS deficiency.<h5>CASE PRESENTATION</h5>. <h5>Chief complaints</h5>|121.0|set()|HP:0000252|47.0|A further individual with compound heterozygous for the missense substitutions p.(Arg739Cys)(Phe556Ser) with microcephaly, growth and developmental delay and neonatal cholestasis was described in 2017 and a seven year old boy compound heterozygous for p.(Gln671fs)(Thr69Ile) has also been reported with hepatopathy, hypotonia, intellectual disability and growth retardation.|['Microcephaly', 'Abnormally small cranium', 'Abnormally small head', 'Abnormally small skull', 'Decreased circumference of cranium', 'Decreased size of cranium', 'Decreased size of head', 'Decreased size of skull', 'Reduced head circumference', 'small calvarium', 'small cranium', 'Small head', 'Small head circumference', 'Small skull']|0.0|None|0.0|0.9436223|INTRODUCTION|109.0

28|HP:0002037|TP|Inflammation of the large intestine|The patient suffered from loose stools from early infancy which became more troublesome and persistent from five years old with ten bloody motions a day.. Repeated endoscopies showed persistent pancolitis, which was refractory to mesalazine, corticosteroids, azathioprine, sirolimus and anti-TNF (adalimumab) therapy, but has improved recently with subcutaneous methotrexate.. Whole Genome Sequencing revealed a novel pathogenic missense variant (c.290A &gt: G) in the cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase gene, leading to an amino acid substitution (p. Asp97Gly).. Pathogenic variants in other genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) () were excluded..

There is some suggestion that sirolimus, which blocks mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 may ameliorate the disease, but use of sirolimus in our patient made no difference to his clinical course.. Maintaining optimal zinc levels may also help optimize aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity, but our patient had normal plasma zinc concentrations and zinc supplements did not help ameliorate his IBD.. It is possible that there are defects in cell turnover and resultant barrier dysfunction of gut mucosa leading to microbe-induced inflammation particularly in the colon..

124|HP:0012115|FP|Hepatitis|T-cells, total B-cells as well as B-cell subsets (transitional, naive, memory, class switching) were within normal range.. Release of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg pathway cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, IL-17A, IL-17F, TNFa and IFNb) that may be deranged in IBD were assayed by cytometric bead array (Becton Dickinson) after 5-d stimulation of purified memory CD4+ T cells with anti-CD2/CD3/CD28 monoclonal antibodies.. Secretion of some inflammatory (IL-2, IL-5, IL-13, IL-9) and immune regulatory (IL-10) cytokines by the patient memory CD4 T-cells was markedly elevated, while IL-17A, IL-17F, IFNb were lower and TNFa not significantly different compared to healthy donors (Figure 1C).<h5>FINAL DIAGNOSIS</h5>. Transient neonatal hepatitis and refractory very early-onset IBD due to cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase.<h5>TREATMENT</h5>. His IBD was refractory to additional zinc supplementation, as well as immune modulation with mesalazine, corticosteroids, azathioprine, sirolimus and anti-TNF therapy (adalimumab).. Recent treatment with subcutaneous methotrexate has led to reduction in his stool frequency to 4 - 5 stools/d with no blood or mucous.<h5>OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP</h5>|28.0|set()|HP:0012115|81.0|Transient neonatal hepatitis and refractory very early-onset IBD due to cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase.<h5>TREATMENT</h5>|['Hepatitis', 'Liver inflammation']|0.0|None|1.0|0.9798366|TREATMENT|19.0
125|HP:0012115|FP|Hepatitis|Maintaining optimal zinc levels may also help optimize aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity, but our patient had normal plasma zinc concentrations and zinc supplements did not help ameliorate his IBD.. It is possible that there are defects in cell turnover and resultant barrier dysfunction of gut mucosa leading to microbe-induced inflammation particularly in the colon.. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may help for severe exacerbations.<h5>CONCLUSION</h5>. This case report provides evidence for a novel monogenic cause of IBD that should be considered, particularly in patients with very early-onset, poor response to treatment and a history of neonatal hepatitis.<h5>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h5>.

Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases/ligases (ARSs) are a group of 20 ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved enzymes involved in attaching each specific amino acid to a tRNA to promote protein synthesis.. ARS deficiencies localized to the mitochondria have been known for 40 years and classically present with lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, failure to thrive and global developmental delay.. Clinical features of cytosolic ARS deficiency are more variable.. In 2016, three unrelated individuals harboring compound homozygous variants in cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase (IARS) [p.(Arg418)(Ile1174Asn), p.(Arg254)(Pro437Leu) and p.(Val370Gly)(Asn992Asp) (MIM: 600709)] were reported.|155.0|set()|HP:0001508|43.0|ARS deficiencies localized to the mitochondria have been known for 40 years and classically present with lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, failure to thrive and global developmental delay.|['Failure to thrive', 'Faltering weight', 'Poor weight gain', 'Postnatal failure to thrive', 'Undergrowth', 'Weight faltering']|0.0|None|0.0|0.95105726|INTRODUCTION|146.0
