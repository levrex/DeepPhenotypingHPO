Abstract<br><h5>BACKGROUND</h5>. Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases/ligases (ARSs) are highly conserved enzymes involved in attaching amino acids to tRNA promoting protein synthesis..

The patient suffered from loose stools from early infancy which became more troublesome and persistent from five years old with ten bloody motions a day.. Repeated endoscopies showed persistent pancolitis, which was refractory to mesalazine, corticosteroids, azathioprine, sirolimus and anti-TNF (adalimumab) therapy, but has improved recently with subcutaneous methotrexate.. Whole Genome Sequencing revealed a novel pathogenic missense variant (c.290A &gt: G) in the cytosolic isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase gene, leading to an amino acid substitution (p. Asp97Gly).. Pathogenic variants in other genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) () were excluded.. Cytokine assays demonstrated markedly elevated IL-2, IL-5, IL-13, IL-9 and IL-10 by the patient's CD4 T-cells, while IL-17A, IL-17F, IFNb were lower, and TNFa not significantly different when compared to healthy controls.<br>. <br>|77.0|{'associated'}|HP:0002037|38.0|Pathogenic variants in other genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) () were excluded.|0.0|None|1.0|1|CASE SUMMARY|51.0

His IBD was refractory to additional zinc supplementation, as well as immune modulation with mesalazine, corticosteroids, azathioprine, sirolimus and anti-TNF therapy (adalimumab).. Recent treatment with subcutaneous methotrexate has led to reduction in his stool frequency to 4 - 5 stools/d with no blood or mucous.<br>. <h5>OUTCOME AND FOLLOW-UP</h5>. Nine-year-old boy with chronic IBD (ten bloody watery stools/day and abdominal pain) despite normal plasma zinc concentration and most standard immune modulatory therapy..

It is possible that there are defects in cell turnover and resultant barrier dysfunction of gut mucosa leading to microbe-induced inflammation particularly in the colon.. Broad-spectrum antibiotics may help for severe exacerbations.<br>. <h5>CONCLUSION</h5>. This case report provides evidence for a novel monogenic cause of IBD that should be considered, particularly in patients with very early-onset, poor response to treatment and a history of neonatal hepatitis.<br>. <h5>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</h5>.
