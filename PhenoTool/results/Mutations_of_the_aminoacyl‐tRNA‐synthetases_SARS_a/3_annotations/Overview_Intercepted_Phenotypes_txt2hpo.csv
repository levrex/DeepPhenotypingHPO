Intellectual disability (ID) is the hallmark of an extremely heterogeneous group of disorders that comprises a wide variety of syndromic and non syndromic phenotypes.. Here, we report on mutations in two aminoacyl tRNA synthetases that are associated with ID in two unrelated Iranian families.. In the first family, we identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.514G&gt:A, p. Asp172Asn) in the cytoplasmic seryl tRNA synthetase () gene.. The mutation affects the enzymatic core domain of the protein and impairs its enzymatic activity, probably leading to reduced cytoplasmic tRNA concentrations.. The mutant protein was predicted to be unstable, which could be substantiated by investigating ectopic mutant SARS in transfected HEK293T cells.. In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase () gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p. Ser109Alafs*15), which very likely entails nonsense mediated mRNA decay and a missense mutation (c.37T&gt:G, p. Trp13Gly).|20.0|{'probably'}|HP:0032320|35.0|The mutation affects the enzymatic core domain of the protein and impairs its enzymatic activity, probably leading to reduced cytoplasmic tRNA concentrations.|0.0|None|1.0|1|Abstract|13.0

(2014).<br>We employed the PyMOL software (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.5.0.1 Schrödinger, LLC) to model the protein structures of the mutant SARS based on the wild type (WT) crystal structures (3VBB) available in the Protein Data Bank PDB (Xu et al., 2012) and performed an in silico analysis to estimate the effect of the mutations on protein stability using Concoord/PBSA (Benedix, Becker, de Groot, Caflisch, &amp: Bockmann, 2009: Potapov, Cohen, &amp: Schreiber, 2009), DUET (URL: http://bleoberis.bioc.cam.ac.uk/duet), SCide (URL: http://www.enzim.hu/scide/), PoPMuSiC (URL: http://www.hsls.pitt.edu/obrc/index.php?page = URL1258139151), MUpro (http://mupro.proteomics.ics.uci.edu.proxy.library.uu.nl/), and I Mutant 2.0 (URL: http://gpcr.biocomp.unibo.it/cgi/predictors/I-Mutant2.0/I-Mutant2.0.cgi).<br>Family 2 was part of a large study of the molecular basis of ARID and genotyping results of six DNA samples (IV:2, IV:3, V:2, V:7, V:8, V:9) from this family were used for homozygosity mapping and multipoint parametric and non parametric linkage analysis.. We identified three homozygous genomic intervals with LOD scores above 2 (Family M153 (Najmabadi et al., 2011)).. Haplotype construction showed homozygous SNP haplotypes for all affected members within these three intervals.. Subsequently, the three homozygous regions were enriched and next generation sequencing was performed but upon filtering no homozygous apparently disease causing mutation could be identified.. More recently, this negative result was confirmed using the medical re sequencing analysis pipeline Medical Re sequencing Analysis Pipeline (MERAP) (Hu et al., 2014) (URL: https://sourceforge.net/projects/merap).|72.0|{'members'}|HP:0032320|81.0|Haplotype construction showed homozygous SNP haplotypes for all affected members within these three intervals.|0.0|m153|1.0|1|2.3 Mutation screening and evaluation|64.0

More recently, this negative result was confirmed using the medical re sequencing analysis pipeline Medical Re sequencing Analysis Pipeline (MERAP) (Hu et al., 2014) (URL: https://sourceforge.net/projects/merap).. This prompted us to perform whole genome sequencing to search for causative mutations even outside the homozygous regions.. Whole genome sequencing was performed in one affected (V:7) by Complete Genomics (Mountain View, CA) as previously described (Drmanac et al., 2010).. The mappable reads sum up to 160G, and the sequence fraction with &gt:10× coverage was 0.976 and with &gt:20× coverage was 0.936.. Sequence reads were mapped to the reference genome (human reference genome, assembly GCRh37/hg19).|53.0|{'previously'}|HP:0032320|85.0|Whole genome sequencing was performed in one affected (V:7) by Complete Genomics (Mountain View, CA) as previously described (Drmanac et al., 2010).|0.0|m153|1.0|1|2.3 Mutation screening and evaluation|45.0

This hairpin belongs to the seven stranded antiparallel β sheet (β1–β9–β10–β11–β13–β8–β7), which is the central core of the aminoacylation domain (Xu et al., 2012).<br>Aspartic acid and asparagine are geometrically similar and protein modeling showed that p. Asp172 faces away from the active site (Supp.. Fig.. S4A), therefore p. Asp172Asn has probably no structure based influence on the catalytic core domain.. However, p. Asp172 could affect aminoacylation activity in an indirect manner as it provides a negative charge.. This negative charge is lost in SARS p. Asp172Asn.. Furthermore, the mutation site p. Asp172 is located directly adjacent to the N terminus of the UNE S domain, which contains the NLS (Supp.|29.0|{'negative'}|HP:0032320|256.0|However, p.

Furthermore, the mutation site p. Asp172 is located directly adjacent to the N terminus of the UNE S domain, which contains the NLS (Supp.. Fig.. S4B and C).. Negative charges within the UNE S domain affect the stability of the positively charged NLS (Xu et al., 2012).. Therefore, the substitution of the negatively charged p.

In the second step, the amino acid is transferred onto the 3′ terminal adenosine of the tRNA that is to be charged and subsequently the charged tRNA and the AMP molecule are released from the enzyme (Schimmel &amp: Soll, 1979).. To understand whether mutant SARS is still able to perform the first step of aminoacylation, we established a pyrophosphate release assay.. As prerequisite  WT and mutant (p. Asp172Asn and p. Thr429Ala) cDNAs were cloned into pGEX6P3.. SARS protein with a p. Thr429Ala mutation is unable to bind serine as this alteration affects a serine binding site (Fig.. 1C) and lacks enzymatic activity (Fukui, Hanaoka, &amp: Kawahara, 2009)..

As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the  gene in the affected individuals of family 2 (Fig.. 1B and D).<br>WARS2 is a nucleus encoded tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase, which is imported into mitochondria.. The protein contains an N terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, and a C terminal domain with tryptophan tRNA ligase activity (Fig.|110.0|{'individuals'}|HP:0032320|310.0|As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the  gene in the affected individuals of family 2 (Fig.|0.0|None|1.0|1|3.7 Impaired serine activation of the SARS p.

Furthermore, it is probably able to load tRNA(Sec) with serine, which would result in a misacylated tRNA, L seryl tRNA(Sec) that can be further converted into selenocysteinyl tRNA(Sec)..

In this context, it is worthwhile mentioning that various tRNA modifiers were already found to play a role in the etiology of ID as well (see Balke, Kuss, &amp: Muller, 2015 for review).. It therefore seems that tRNA modification and  aminoacylation are emerging to be among the more prominent pathways contributing to the molecular background of human cognitive disorders and in conclusion, we would like to present the notion that not only a full but also a fully functional complement of tRNAs is vital for the development and maintenance of higher brain functions.<br><h2> ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</h2>. <br>.
