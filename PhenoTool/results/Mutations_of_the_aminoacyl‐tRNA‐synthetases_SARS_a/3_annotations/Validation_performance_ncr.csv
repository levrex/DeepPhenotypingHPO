1|HP:0000708|TP|Behavioral abnormality|Selenoproteins are involved in protein folding, degradation of misfolded membrane proteins, and control of cellular calcium homeostasis (Andersen, 2004).. Interestingly, deletion of selenoprotein P (Sepp1) in mice produces both neuronal and axonal degeneration as well as potentially reversible neurite changes in the developing brain (Caito et al., 2011).. Neuron specific ablation of selenoprotein expression causes a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative phenotype in mice, affecting the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, particularly the parvalbumin (PV) positive interneuron population (Wirth et al., 2010).. Moreover, loss of PV neurons is associated with some neuropsychiatric disorders, for example, autism spectrum disorders (Sgado et al., 2013).<br>Specifically with respect to SARS p. Asp172Asn, our overexpression experiments, which we carried out in HEK293T cells, because of their high transfection efficiency and because they are commonly used to assess an impairment of localization in the mitochondria, showed that in comparison to the ectopic WT protein the level of ectopic p. Asp172Asn was significantly reduced in whole cell extracts as well as in the cytosolic fraction.. As transfection rates for both were similar this is most likely due to the mutation, suggesting reduced protein stability of mutant SARS, which is also in line with our 3D modeling results.. Intriguingly, the observed amounts of WT and mutant SARS in the nuclear fraction were similar, indicating that while the mutation seems to affect the overall stability and function of the SARS gene product, the nuclear transport properties seem to be unaffected.|79.0|{'associated'}|HP:0000708|388.0|Moreover, loss of PV neurons is associated with some neuropsychiatric disorders, for example, autism spectrum disorders (Sgado et al., 2013).<br>Specifically with respect to SARS p.

2|HP:0000718|TP|Aggressive behavior|ARSs are essential and ubiquitously expressed enzymes and responsible for ligating amino acids to cognate tRNA molecules (aminoacylation) in mitochondria and in the cytosol.. Mutations in at least five mitochondrial ARSs have already been associated with brain specific phenotypes, and at least four genes encoding cytoplasmic ARS have been implicated in inherited peripheral neuropathy with an axonal pathology (for review see, e.g., Oprescu, Griffin, Beg, &amp: Antonellis, 2016: Wallen &amp: Antonellis, 2013: Yao &amp: Fox, 2013).<br>Here, we report on two Iranian families affected by ARID with similar accompanying features (Table 1)..

26|HP:0001251|TP|Ataxia|Similar observations were made by Sauter et al.. (2015) who report that carriers of compound  mutations show the strongest effects concerning DARS2 solubility and activity, when missense mutations occur in combination with a splicing defect on the second allele.<br>Interestingly, ectopic expression of WT WARS2 in HEK293T cells induced a significant reduction in the amount of SDHA protein as compared with controls or to cells overexpressing the p. Trp13Gly variant of WARS2.. Based on the canonical function of WARS2, this might suggest a role for this protein in the translation of SDHA, which would then be partially impaired in the mutant protein.. This is noteworthy, since homozygous mutations in the  gene cause Leigh syndrome and Mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II deficiency (MIM# 256000, MIM# 252011) in patients that present, among other features, ataxia, muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, and seizures.<br>We believe that WARS2 p. Trp13Gly is in fact a functional polymorphism (Albert, 2011) that is uncovered by a loss of the gene product from the second allele..

34|HP:0002011|TP|Morphological central nervous system abnormality|Tryptamine induces axonopathy and mitochondriopathy mimicking neurodegenerative diseases via tryptophanyl tRNA deficiency (Paley, Perry, &amp: Sokolova, 2013).<br>Regarding WARS2, it is interesting to note that mutations in human mitochondrial ARSs are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases and that all other mitochondrial ARSs, were already found to be subject to pathology related mutations (Diodato, Ghezzi, &amp: Tiranti, 2014: Hallmann et al., 2014: Konovalova &amp: Tyynismaa, 2013: Schwartzentruber et al., 2014: Schwenzer, Zoll, Florentz, &amp: Sissler, 2014: Sofou et al., 2015: Suzuki, Nagao, &amp: Suzuki, 2011).. Mitochondrial protein synthesis is central to the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS).. Why clinical consequences of mutations in essential genes are restricted to the brain is still unclear, however, it has been suggested before that, given the fundamental function of mitochondrial ARSs, a loss of function is incompatible with life but that low enzyme activity may be sufficient to allow uterine development yet still result in specific disorders during postnatal life (Konovalova &amp: Tyynismaa, 2013).. The high demand of energy for the maintenance of brain functions makes the central nervous system particularly sensitive to disturbances in the (mitochondrial) OXPHOS and it is conceivable that cognitive functions, being the last to develop during evolution, suffer first from imbalances in the energy supply system.. When present at crucial neurodevelopmental stages such disturbances could result in permanent damage, while other tissues or functions might not be affected, the residual WARS2 activity being sufficient to cover the demand in these cases.<br>Furthermore, synapses might be particularly vulnerable to imbalances in the cell  or energy metabolism caused by either cytoplasmic or mitochondrial class I and class II ARSs (Najmabadi et al., 2011).. As reviewed by Valnegri, Sala, and Passafaro (2012), more than 50% of ID related proteins are enriched in synaptic compartments and may be involved in synaptic plasticity, synapse formation and cytoskeleton rearrangement (see also Ropers &amp: Hamel, 2005).|90.0|set()|HP:0002011|398.0|The high demand of energy for the maintenance of brain functions makes the central nervous system particularly sensitive to disturbances in the (mitochondrial) OXPHOS and it is conceivable that cognitive functions, being the last to develop during evolution, suffer first from imbalances in the energy supply system.|['Morphological abnormality of the central nervous system', 'Abnormality of the central nervous system', 'Central nervous system disease', 'Morphological abnormality of the CNS']|0.0|None|0.0|0.82331496|4 DISCUSSION|75.0

Selenocysteine for example is an essential component of the 25 selenoproteins encoded in the human genome (Lu &amp: Holmgren, 2009).. Selenoproteins are involved in protein folding, degradation of misfolded membrane proteins, and control of cellular calcium homeostasis (Andersen, 2004).. Interestingly, deletion of selenoprotein P (Sepp1) in mice produces both neuronal and axonal degeneration as well as potentially reversible neurite changes in the developing brain (Caito et al., 2011).. Neuron specific ablation of selenoprotein expression causes a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative phenotype in mice, affecting the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, particularly the parvalbumin (PV) positive interneuron population (Wirth et al., 2010).. Moreover, loss of PV neurons is associated with some neuropsychiatric disorders, for example, autism spectrum disorders (Sgado et al., 2013).<br>Specifically with respect to SARS p. Asp172Asn, our overexpression experiments, which we carried out in HEK293T cells, because of their high transfection efficiency and because they are commonly used to assess an impairment of localization in the mitochondria, showed that in comparison to the ectopic WT protein the level of ectopic p.

Mutations in at least five mitochondrial ARSs have already been associated with brain specific phenotypes, and at least four genes encoding cytoplasmic ARS have been implicated in inherited peripheral neuropathy with an axonal pathology (for review see, e.g., Oprescu, Griffin, Beg, &amp: Antonellis, 2016: Wallen &amp: Antonellis, 2013: Yao &amp: Fox, 2013).<br>Here, we report on two Iranian families affected by ARID with similar accompanying features (Table 1).. Using homozygosity mapping, next generation sequencing and Sanger sequencing approaches, we have identified mutations in two different ARS genes..

Moreover, muscular weakness was repeatedly observed in the context of tRNA related disorders in general or ARS related conditions in particular, for example, Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease (MIM# 607731) and others (see e.g..

114|HP:0100543|FP|Cognitive impairment|Similar observations were made by Sauter et al.. (2015) who report that carriers of compound  mutations show the strongest effects concerning DARS2 solubility and activity, when missense mutations occur in combination with a splicing defect on the second allele.<br>Interestingly, ectopic expression of WT WARS2 in HEK293T cells induced a significant reduction in the amount of SDHA protein as compared with controls or to cells overexpressing the p. Trp13Gly variant of WARS2.. Based on the canonical function of WARS2, this might suggest a role for this protein in the translation of SDHA, which would then be partially impaired in the mutant protein..

115|HP:0100543|FP|Cognitive impairment|Tryptamine induces axonopathy and mitochondriopathy mimicking neurodegenerative diseases via tryptophanyl tRNA deficiency (Paley, Perry, &amp: Sokolova, 2013).<br>Regarding WARS2, it is interesting to note that mutations in human mitochondrial ARSs are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases and that all other mitochondrial ARSs, were already found to be subject to pathology related mutations (Diodato, Ghezzi, &amp: Tiranti, 2014: Hallmann et al., 2014: Konovalova &amp: Tyynismaa, 2013: Schwartzentruber et al., 2014: Schwenzer, Zoll, Florentz, &amp: Sissler, 2014: Sofou et al., 2015: Suzuki, Nagao, &amp: Suzuki, 2011).. Mitochondrial protein synthesis is central to the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS).. Why clinical consequences of mutations in essential genes are restricted to the brain is still unclear, however, it has been suggested before that, given the fundamental function of mitochondrial ARSs, a loss of function is incompatible with life but that low enzyme activity may be sufficient to allow uterine development yet still result in specific disorders during postnatal life (Konovalova &amp: Tyynismaa, 2013).. The high demand of energy for the maintenance of brain functions makes the central nervous system particularly sensitive to disturbances in the (mitochondrial) OXPHOS and it is conceivable that cognitive functions, being the last to develop during evolution, suffer first from imbalances in the energy supply system.. When present at crucial neurodevelopmental stages such disturbances could result in permanent damage, while other tissues or functions might not be affected, the residual WARS2 activity being sufficient to cover the demand in these cases.<br>Furthermore, synapses might be particularly vulnerable to imbalances in the cell  or energy metabolism caused by either cytoplasmic or mitochondrial class I and class II ARSs (Najmabadi et al., 2011).. As reviewed by Valnegri, Sala, and Passafaro (2012), more than 50% of ID related proteins are enriched in synaptic compartments and may be involved in synaptic plasticity, synapse formation and cytoskeleton rearrangement (see also Ropers &amp: Hamel, 2005).|203.0|set()|HP:0100543|398.0|The high demand of energy for the maintenance of brain functions makes the central nervous system particularly sensitive to disturbances in the (mitochondrial) OXPHOS and it is conceivable that cognitive functions, being the last to develop during evolution, suffer first from imbalances in the energy supply system.|['Cognitive impairment', 'Abnormality of cognition', 'Cognitive abnormality', 'Cognitive defects', 'Cognitive deficits', 'Cognitive impairment', 'Intellectual impairment', 'Mental impairment']|0.0|None|0.0|0.95951575|4 DISCUSSION|194.0

Histological data, which also show a correlation between the severity of ID and the severity of dendritic spine malformations (Valnegri et al., 2012), further corroborate the hypothesis that some features of ID are caused by alterations in synaptic functions.. Thus, for further experiments aimed at investigating a possible effect on synapse morphology neuronal cell lines or primary neurons might be advantageous.<br>Interestingly, SARS and WARS2 also seem to interact directly in some cases, as an analysis using the STRING (http://string-db.org, (Szklarczyk et al., 2015), last accessed 07/2016) database showed..
