Share on<br><h2>Abstract</h2>. <br>. <br>. Intellectual disability (ID) is the hallmark of an extremely heterogeneous group of disorders that comprises a wide variety of syndromic and non syndromic phenotypes.. Here, we report on mutations in two aminoacyl tRNA synthetases that are associated with ID in two unrelated Iranian families.. In the first family, we identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.514G&gt:A, p. Asp172Asn) in the cytoplasmic seryl tRNA synthetase () gene.|23.0|{'non'}|HP:0001249|32.0|Intellectual disability (ID) is the hallmark of an extremely heterogeneous group of disorders that comprises a wide variety of syndromic and non syndromic phenotypes.|['Intellectual disability', 'Dull intelligence', 'Intellectual disability', 'Low intelligence', 'Mental deficiency', 'Mental retardation', 'Mental retardation, nonspecific', 'Mental-retardation', 'Nonprogressive intellectual disability', 'Nonprogressive mental retardation', 'Poor school performance']|0.0|None|1.0|0.9938634|Abstract|0.0
In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase () gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p. Ser109Alafs*15), which very likely entails nonsense mediated mRNA decay and a missense mutation (c.37T&gt:G, p. Trp13Gly).. The latter affects the mitochondrial localization signal of WARS2, causing protein mislocalization.. Including , which we have recently implicated in the etiology of ID, three genes with a role in tRNA aminoacylation are now associated with this condition.. We therefore suggest that the functional integrity of tRNAs in general is an important factor in the development and maintenance of human cognitive functions.<br><h2>1 INTRODUCTION</h2>. <br>.
