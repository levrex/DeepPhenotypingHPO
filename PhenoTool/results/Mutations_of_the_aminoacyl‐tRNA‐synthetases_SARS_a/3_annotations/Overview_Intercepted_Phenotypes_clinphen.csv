Intellectual disability (ID) is the hallmark of an extremely heterogeneous group of disorders that comprises a wide variety of syndromic and non syndromic phenotypes.. Here, we report on mutations in two aminoacyl tRNA synthetases that are associated with ID in two unrelated Iranian families.. In the first family, we identified a homozygous missense mutation (c.514G&gt:A, p. Asp172Asn) in the cytoplasmic seryl tRNA synthetase () gene.. The mutation affects the enzymatic core domain of the protein and impairs its enzymatic activity, probably leading to reduced cytoplasmic tRNA concentrations.. The mutant protein was predicted to be unstable, which could be substantiated by investigating ectopic mutant SARS in transfected HEK293T cells.. In the second family, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the mitochondrial tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase () gene, comprising a nonsense mutation (c.325delA, p. Ser109Alafs*15), which very likely entails nonsense mediated mRNA decay and a missense mutation (c.37T&gt:G, p. Trp13Gly).|44.0|{'probably'}|HP:0031987|35.0|The mutation affects the enzymatic core domain of the protein and impairs its enzymatic activity, probably leading to reduced cytoplasmic tRNA concentrations.|['Diminished ability to concentrate']|0.0|None|1.0|1|Abstract|22.0

With a prevalence between 1% and 3%, intellectual disability (ID) is among the most important problems in healthcare.. Particularly, hereditary autosomal recessive forms of the disorder (autosomal recessive intellectual disability [ARID]) have a very heterogeneous molecular basis, and genes with an increased number of disease causing mutations are not common (for review see, e.g., Khan et al., 2016: Musante &amp: Ropers, 2013).. Interestingly, apart from genes specifically expressed in synapses or in the nervous system, many ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes have been implicated in ARID and neurological disorders (Najmabadi et al., 2011).|36.0|set()|HP:0001249|42.0|With a prevalence between 1% and 3%, intellectual disability (ID) is among the most important problems in healthcare.|['Intellectual disability']|0.0|None|0.0|1|1 INTRODUCTION|18.0

In the case of family 1, linkage analysis and autozygosity mapping were carried out.. Genotyping (SNP analysis) was performed using 50k Genome Wide Human SNP Array Version 2 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) (Kennedy et al., 2003) based on previously published protocols (Matsuzaki et al., 2004) for all available individuals from family 1.. We used Alohomora 11 software v0.32 (Ruschendorf &amp: Nurnberg, 2005) for SNP array quality controls, as described previously (Garshasbi et al., 2006).. The program Merlin was applied for parametric multipoint linkage analysis consistent with an AR mode of inheritance, a disease allele frequency of 10 and complete penetrance (Abecasis, Cherny, Cookson, &amp: Cardon, 2002).<br><h3>2.3 Mutation screening and evaluation</h3>. <br>. Mutation screening for family 1 was performed by PCR analysis and subsequent Sanger sequencing of all exons and exon-intron boundaries of all protein coding genes within the linkage interval, which was flanked by the heterozygous SNPs rs10494061 and rs1938250 and contained 133 RefSeq genes (human reference genome, assembly GCRh37/hg19), using the DNA of the index patient (V:1).|72.0|set()|HP:0000005|69.0|The program Merlin was applied for parametric multipoint linkage analysis consistent with an AR mode of inheritance, a disease allele frequency of 10 and complete penetrance (Abecasis, Cherny, Cookson, &amp: Cardon, 2002).<br><h3>2.3 Mutation screening and evaluation</h3>|['Mode of inheritance']|0.0|family 1|1.0|1|2.3 Mutation screening and evaluation|36.0

Mutations of single amino acid mutations can significantly change the stability of a protein structure.. The p. Asp172 was predicted in silico to be a stabilization center element by the SCide software (Dosztanyi, Magyar, Tusnady, &amp: Simon, 2003) using PDB structure 3VBB and chain F. To understand whether the stability of SARS protein was influenced by the loss of the negative charge at residue 172, protein stability was assessed by MUpro, I Mutant (DD = -2.06) and PoPMuSiC (DD = 0.62 kcal/mol).. All three tools predicted a moderate decrease in protein stability upon mutation.. Even more important, in silico energy calculations with the Concoord/PBSA method (Benedix et al., 2009), which calculates stability changes upon mutation confirmed a decrease in stability (DD = -1.06).<br>To gain insights into the structural consequences of the p. Asp172Asn mutation, structure based  modeling of the p. Asp172Asn amino acid substitution was performed using the crystal structure 3VBB of human SARS (Xu et al., 2012).. p.

<br>. As a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the  gene in the affected individuals of family 2 (Fig.. 1B and D).<br>WARS2 is a nucleus encoded tryptophanyl tRNA synthetase, which is imported into mitochondria.. The protein contains an N terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, and a C terminal domain with tryptophan tRNA ligase activity (Fig.. 1D).. Furthermore, it is probably able to load tRNA(Sec) with serine, which would result in a misacylated tRNA, L seryl tRNA(Sec) that can be further converted into selenocysteinyl tRNA(Sec).|40.0|set()|HP:0001427|312.0|The protein contains an N terminal mitochondrial targeting signal, and a C terminal domain with tryptophan tRNA ligase activity (Fig.|['Mitochondrial inheritance']|0.0|None|1.0|1|3.7 Impaired serine activation of the SARS p.

Interestingly, deletion of selenoprotein P (Sepp1) in mice produces both neuronal and axonal degeneration as well as potentially reversible neurite changes in the developing brain (Caito et al., 2011).. Neuron specific ablation of selenoprotein expression causes a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative phenotype in mice, affecting the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, particularly the parvalbumin (PV) positive interneuron population (Wirth et al., 2010)..
