musante &amp; ropers, ). interestingly, apart from genes specifically expressed in synapses or in the nervous system, many ubiquitously expressed housekeeping genes have been implicated in arid and neurological disorders (najmabadi etal., ). in line with these findings, we identified mutations in two aminoacyltrna synthetases (arss) in families with arid. arss are essential and ubiquitously expressed enzymes and responsible for ligating amino acids to cognate trna molecules (aminoacylation) in mitochondria and in the cytosol.  <span style="color:red">mutations in at least five mitochondrial arss have already been associated with brainspecific phenotypes,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">at least four genes encoding cytoplasmic ars have been implicated in inherited peripheral neuropathy with an axonal pathology (for review see,</span>  <span style="color:red">e.g.,</span>  <span style="color:red">oprescu,</span> griffin, beg, &amp; antonellis, ; wallen &amp; antonellis, ; yao &amp; fox, ).<br>here, we report on two iranian families affected by arid with similar accompanying features (table ). using homozygosity mapping, nextgeneration sequencing and sanger sequencing approaches, we have identified mutations in two different ars genes. in the first family, homozygosity mapping in combination with subsequent mutation screening revealed a homozygous missense mutation in the () gene (mim# 607529), which cosegregates with moderate id,  <span style="color:red">microcephaly,</span>  <span style="color:red">ataxia,</span>  <span style="color:red">speech impairment,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">aggressive behavior.</span> the variant affects an amino acid residue that is highly conserved across the animal kingdom and it leads to unstable protein expression in mammalian cells. moreover, the missense change leads to reduced enzymatic activity .<br>in the second family, we found compound dnaalterations affecting the mitochondrial () gene (mim# 604733) by whole genome sequencing and  <span style="color:red">could show that both cosegregate with moderate id,</span>  <span style="color:red">ataxia,</span>  <span style="color:red">speech impairment,</span>  <span style="color:red">microcephaly,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">aggressive behavior.</span> the frameshift mutation on the paternal allele (c.325dela, p. ser109alafs*159) very likely leads to the degradation of mrna by nmd, given its position relative to the terminal exon. the second change (c.37t&gt;g, p. trp13gly), on the maternal allele, affects a mitochondrial signal peptide (sp) leading to mislocalization of the mutant protein in the cells.<br>and add to the list of ubiquitously expressed genes implicated in arid.<br>furthermore, our results underscore the importance of arss in neuronal function and brain development.<br><h2>2 materials and methods</h2><br><br><h3>2.1 subjects and sampling</h3><br>the study was approved by the ethics committee of the university of social welfare and rehabilitation sciences, tehran, iran. the patients and their families were recruited by the genetics research center at the university of social welfare and rehabilitation sciences, tehran, iran, where genetic counselors obtained informed consent of the parents from both families in writing. the probands were examined by experienced clinical geneticists who assessed their physical and mental status. blood samples for dna preparation were collected and genomic dna was extracted using a standard method.<br><br>to exclude chromosomal abnormalities and metabolic disorders, respectively, we performed karyotype analysis by gbanding and tandem mass spectrometry, using filterdried blood from at least one patient of each nuclear family. fragile xsyndrome was also excluded.<br><h3>2.2 linkage analysis and autozygosity mapping</h3><br>in the case of family 1, linkage analysis and autozygosity mapping were carried out. genotyping (snp analysis) was performed using 50k genomewide human snp array version 2 (affymetrix, santa clara, ca) (kennedy etal., ) based on previously published protocols (matsuzaki etal., ) for all available individuals from family 1. we used alohomora 11 software v0.32 (ruschendorf &amp; nurnberg, ) for snp array quality controls, as described previously (garshasbi etal., ). the program merlin was applied for parametric multipoint linkage analysis consistent with an ar mode of inheritance, a disease allele frequency of 10 and complete penetrance (abecasis, cherny, cookson, &amp; cardon, ).<br><h3>2.3 mutation screening and evaluation</h3><br>mutation screening for family 1 was performed by pcr analysis and subsequent sanger sequencing of all exons and exonintron boundaries of all proteincoding genes within the linkage interval, which was flanked by the heterozygous snps rs10494061 and rs1938250 and contained 133 refseq genes (human reference genome, assembly gcrh37/hg19), using the dna of the index patient (v:1). primers were designed by using primer3 software (url: ) (rozen &amp; skaletsky, ). in case of the only plausible candidate gene, , pcr was performed in independent pcr reactions (primers are listed in supp. table s1). in addition, siblings and parents were also sequenced, when available, to confirm appropriate cosegregation of the allele within the families. furthermore, ethnically matched unrelated healthy individuals as well as unrelated healthy german individuals were also directly screened for the mutations. moreover, we used the publically available sequencing databases as well as inhouse databases containing more than 400 exomes to further extend the control cohort. the dna mutation numbering system used is based on the cdna sequence where +1 is the a of the atg translation initiation codon in the reference sequence.<br>in silico prediction of pathogenic effect of the variants identified in this study was performed using polyphen2 (adzhubei etal., ), sift (ng &amp; henikoff, ), mutation taster (schwarz, rodelsperger, schuelke, &amp; seelow, ), and logit score developed by hu etal. ().<br>we employed the pymol software (the pymol molecular graphics system, version 1.5.0.1 schrodinger, llc) to model the protein structures of the mutant sars based on the wildtype (wt) crystal structures (3vbb) available in the protein data bank pdb (xu etal., ) and performed an in silico analysis to estimate the effect of the mutations on protein stability using concoord/pbsa (benedix, becker, de groot, caflisch, &amp; bockmann, ; potapov, cohen, &amp; schreiber, ), duet (url: ), scide (url: ), popmusic (url: = url1258139151), mupro (), and imutant 2.0 (url: ).<br>family 2 was part of a large study of the molecular basis of arid and genotyping results of six dna samples (iv:2, iv:3, v:2, v:7, v:8, v:9) from this family were used for homozygosity mapping and multipoint parametric and nonparametric linkage analysis. we identified three homozygous genomic intervals with lod scores above 2 (family m153 (najmabadi etal., )). haplotype construction showed homozygous snp haplotypes for all affected members within these three intervals. subsequently, the three homozygous regions were enriched and next generation sequencing was performed but upon filtering no homozygous apparently diseasecausing mutation could be identified. more recently, this negative result was confirmed using the medical resequencing analysis pipeline medical resequencing analysis pipeline (merap) (hu etal., ) (url: ). this prompted us to perform whole genome sequencing to search for causative mutations even outside the homozygous regions. whole genome sequencing was performed in one affected (v:7) by complete genomics (mountain view, ca) as previously described (drmanac etal., ). the mappable reads sum up to 160g, and the sequence fraction with &gt;10 coverage was 0.976 and with &gt;20 coverage was 0.936. sequence reads were mapped to the reference genome (human reference genome, assembly gcrh37/hg19). variants were ranked and prioritized as potential candidates as previously described (najmabadi etal., ), using an improved version of merap (hu etal., ). the omim catalogue (url: ) and the human gene mutation database (hgmd, url: ) were used as a filter to identify all previously described pathogenic changes. furthermore data were filtered against multiple publically available databases including dbsnp138, sequencing data from the exome variant server (nhlbi exome sequencing project (esp), seattle, wa, url: ), 200 danish individuals (li etal., ), 185 genomes of healthy individuals made available by the 1,000 genome project (url: ) and exome aggregation consortium (exac), cambridge, ma (url: ) [january 13, 2015]. we retained variants that were present with a minor allele frequency below 0.01. in addition, variants were compared with inhouse databases containing more than 400 exomes. the mutations within the candidate gene were verified by sanger sequencing (primers are listed in supp. table s1). siblings and parents were also sequenced, when available, to confirm cosegregation of the alleles within the family. furthermore, ethnically matched unrelated healthy individuals as well as unrelated healthy german individuals were also directly screened for the mutations. dna mutation numbering system used is based on cdna sequence where +1 is the a of the atg translation initiation codon in the reference sequence.<br>in silico analysis of the putative pathogenic missense change was performed using project hope (url: ). prediction of the pathogenic effect of the variant found in this study was performed using various softwares:<br><h3>2.4 sanger sequencing</h3><br>sequencing reactions were prepared using the abi prism big dye terminator cycle sequencing v3.1 ready reaction kit (life technologies, thermo fisher, waltham, ma) and sequenced on a 3500 genetic analyzer for resequencing &amp; fragment analysis (applied biosystems, thermo fisher, waltham, ma). subsequently, data were analyzed using codoncode aligner software (codoncode corporation, centerville, ma).<br><h3>2.5 rnasequencing</h3><br>expression levels of mrna corresponding to (nm_006513.3) and (nm_015836.3) were obtained by rnasequencing of commercially available rnasamples from different brain tissues. rnasequencing was carried out on a solid5500xl sequencing platform (life technologies, thermo fisher scientific, waltham, ma, usa) as previously described (konze etal., ).<br><h3>2.6 cloning of and cdnas<br></h3><br>a fulllength cdna clone (iraup969h0860d) was purchased from imagenes gmbh (berlin, germany). the cdna was isolated from a neuroblastoma cell line and contained a change from cytosine to thymine at c.1530, resulting in a missense mutation from arginine to cysteine at position 435 in the sars protein. to correct the c.1530c&gt;t change, mutagenesis was performed with the quickchange ii xl sitedirected mutagenesis kit (stratagene, la jolla, ca).<br>the complete cdna was amplified using primers containing hi and i restriction sites and then cloned in the mammalian expression vector peyfpn1, and in the vector for protein expression in prokaryotic organism, pgex6p3. primers (listed in supp. table s2) were designed using the quikchange primer design program (url: ). to obtain c.514g&gt;a (p. asp172asn) and c.1285a&gt;g (p. thr429ala), sitedirected mutagenesis was performed as described using sense and antisense primers carrying the respective nucleotide changes (see supp. table s2)<br>complete cdna was obtained by pcr using primers wars2cdnafw and wars2cdnarv using total rna from human fetal brain (biochain, san francisco, ca, usa). the pcr product was also used as template for further amplification with primers wars2egfpfw and wars2egfprvn containing i and diii restriction sites (see supp. table s2). after restriction digestion the fragment was inserted into the mammalian expression vector peyfpn1. to obtain the c.37t&gt;g (p. trp13gly) change, mutagenesis was performed with the quickchange ii xl sitedirected mutagenesis kit (stratagene) (see supp. table s2 for primer sequences).<br><h3>2.7 cell culture and treatment</h3><br>cos7 and hek293t cells were maintained in dmem medium containing 10% fbs, and supplemented with lglutamine and penicillin/streptomycin. all transient transfection experiments were performed with lipofectamine 2000 (invitrogen, thermo fisher, waltham, ma, usa) according to the manufacturer's recommendations. 510 cos7 cells were seeded in sixwell plates and transfected with 0.5g plasmid dna per well and 2l lipofectamine, whereas 110 cells were seeded in 75cm flask, transfected with 5g dna per flask and 15l transfection reagent. after 24hr, cells were fixed for immunofluorescence microscopy analysis or harvested. to stain mitochondria in live cells, cells were incubated with 250mm mitotracker deep red fm (m22426; invitrogen, thermo fisher scientific, waltham, ma, usa) for 20min before harvesting them.<br><h3>2.8 generation of whole cell lysates</h3><br>wt and mutant constructs were transfected into hek293t and/or cos7 cells. after 24hr, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 110 for 5min using a rotanta 46k centrifuge (hettich, tuttlingen, germany) and washed once in 1pbs. the pellet was resuspended into lysis buffer (15mm trishcl, ph 7.5, 48% urea, 8.7% glycerol, 1% sds, 0.004% bromophenol blue, and 143mm mercaptoethanol) and then sonicated 10sec/two cycles/max power with sonoplus hd 2070 (bandelin, berlin, germany).<br><h3>2.9 cell fractionation</h3><br>eyfpsars wt and mutant expression vectors were transfected into hek293t cells. after 24hr, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 1,000rpm for 5min using a rotanta 46k centrifuge (hettich) and washed once in 1pbs. the pellet was resuspended in 400l cell fractionation lysis buffer (20mm hepes, ph 7.4, 50mm nacl, 5mm mgcl2 protease inhibitors and 80g/ml digitonin) and incubated at rt for 10min, then centrifuged at 956 g for 10min (centrifuge 5417r; eppendorf, hauppauge, ny). the supernatant, which contained the cytosolic fraction, was removed and the pellet was washed twice with cell fractionation lysis buffer. the pellet, which contained the membrane and nuclear fraction, was resuspended in 150l of lysis buffer (15mm trishcl, ph 7.5, 48% urea, 8.7% glycerol, 1% sds, 0.004% bromophenol blue, and 143mm mercaptoethanol) followed by sonication.<br><h3>2.10 mitochondria isolation</h3><br>mitochondria were isolated using the mitochondria isolation kit for cultured cells (thermo fisher scientific, waltham, ma, usa) following the manufacturer's instructions (option b). modifications were done as follow: step 3, cells were lysed by sonication 5sec/32 cycles/max power. step 8 and 11, pellets contained nuclei/membranes and mitochondria, respectively, were dissolved in 200l of lysis buffer (see above) and passed through qiashredder (qiagen, venlo, netherlands) to reduce viscosity.<br><br>protein concentration was measured by nanodrop (nd1000; thermo fisher scientific, waltham, ma, usa).<br><h3>2.11 western blot</h3><br>protein extracts (525g) were loaded on 10% to 15% sdsgels. the gels were blotted for 1hr at 20v. membranes were blocked at rt either in 5% bsa or 5% milk in pbst for 1hr. incubation with 1st antibody in 5% milk in pbst was done overnight at 4c. membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies, diluted in pbst, for 1hr at room temperature. to detect immunolabeled proteins, we used western lightningecl, enhanced chemiluminescence substrate (perkinelmer inc., waltham, ma, usa).<br><h3>2.12 immunocytochemistry</h3><br>cells were fixed for 10min with 4% pfa in pbs, permeabilized in 0.2% triton x in pbs for 5min, and incubated with 4% bsa in pbs for 1hr at room temperature. they were then incubated overnight with the primary antibodies in the same solution at 4c, washed three times with pbs and subsequently incubated with secondary antibodies in blocking solution (1hr), and again washed three times with pbs, dipped in water and mounted with fluoromount g (southern biotech, birmingham, al) and 0.5g dapi/ml. images were acquired using a confocal laserscanning microscope (laser scanning microscope lsm700, carl zeiss, oberkochen, germany) with a 63objective and were analyzed with the carl zeiss zen 2012 software.<br><h3>2.13 antibodies</h3><br>the following antibodies were used: antisars, clone 1h4;

nm_006513.3: c.514g&gt;a) (fig. c) (coordinates used correspond to human reference genome, assembly gcrh37/hg19) was found in exon five and results in a change from aspartic acid to asparagine at amino acid position 172 (np_006504.4: p. asp172asn). in addition, a variant (chr1: 120166494g&gt;t; nm_001080470.1: c.472c&gt;a) in the third exon of the zinc finger protein 697 () gene was found, which results in a substitution of proline with threonine at amino acid position 158 (np_001073939: p. pro158thr), but was predicted to be benign by several different pathogenicity evaluators (polyphen2, sift, mutation taster, and logit score). only the amino acid substitution in sars was predicted to be damaging and thus identified as the most plausible pathogenic change in family 1. c.514g&gt;a was not present in dbsnp 138, 200 danish individuals (li etal., ) 185 genomes of healthy individuals made available by the 1000 genome project (1000 genomes project consortium etal., ), the nhlbi exome variant server (esp6500), or in the exac database (version 3.0). it was also absent from our inhouse databases containing more than 400 exomes, from more than 1,000 chromosomes from ethnically matched controls and from 432 chromosomes of specifically tested german controls. the variant was submitted to the public leiden open variation database 3.0 ().<br>the mutation affects a highly conserved amino acid (fig. c) and, in line with this, the phylop score (pollard, hubisz, rosenbloom, &amp; siepel, ) was found to be 6.457.<br>expression of was determined by rnaseq in different human brain regions relevant for learning and memory (supp. fig. s3).<br>sars encodes the cytosolic seryltrna synthetase, a protein that contains three domains: an nterminal trna binding arm, an aminoacylation domain and a cterminal unes domain containing the nuclear localization signal (nls) addin en. cite (xu etal., ). the amino acid substitution p. asp172asn found in family 1 is located in the aminoacylation core domain (fig. c), in close proximity to the active site (see also supp. fig. s4).<br><h3>3.5 the amino acid substitution p. asp172asn destabilizes sars</h3><br>mutations of single amino acid mutations can significantly change the stability of a protein structure. the p. asp172 was predicted in silico to be a stabilization center element by the scide software (dosztanyi, magyar, tusnady, &amp; simon, ) using pdb structure 3vbb and chain f. to understand whether the stability of sars protein was influenced by the loss of the negative charge at residue 172, protein stability was assessed by mupro, imutant (=2.06) and popmusic (=0.62kcal/mol). all three tools predicted a moderate decrease in protein stability upon mutation. even more important, in silico energy calculations with the concoord/pbsa method (benedix etal., ), which calculates stability changes upon mutation confirmed a decrease in stability (=1.06).<br>to gain insights into the structural consequences of the p. asp172asn mutation, structurebased modeling of the p. asp172asn amino acid substitution was performed using the crystalstructure 3vbb of human sars (xu etal., ). p. asp172 is located in the aminoacylation domain, in close proximity to p. his170 (supp. fig. s3a). xu etal. (2012) have also shown that residues p. his170 and p. phe316 form hydrophobic interactions to stabilize the 10 11 hairpin. this hairpin belongs to the sevenstranded antiparallel sheet (1910111387), which is the central core of the aminoacylation domain (xu etal., ).<br>aspartic acid and asparagine are geometrically similar and protein modeling showed that p. asp172 faces away from the active site (supp. fig. s4a), therefore p. asp172asn has probably no structurebased influence on the catalytic core domain. however, p. asp172 could affect aminoacylation activity in an indirect manner as it provides a negative charge. this negative charge is lost in sars p. asp172asn. furthermore, the mutation site p. asp172 is located directly adjacent to the nterminus of the unes domain, which contains the nls (supp. fig. s4b and c). negative charges within the unes domain affect the stability of the positively charged nls (xu etal., ). therefore, the substitution of the negatively charged p. asp172 by the positively chargedp. asn172 could influence the subcellular localization of the sars protein.<br><h3>3.6 expression analysis of sars p. asp172asn in mammalian cells</h3><br>to test the hypothesis that p. asp172asn might influence the localization pattern of sars, we cloned wt and mutant sars in frame with c terminal eyfp tag. in parallel, subcellular localization of endogenous sars was analyzed using a monoclonal sars antibody. confocal microscopy revealed a similar cytoplasmic localization of endogenous and ectopic sars proteins in all cell lines tested (data not shown) which is in agreement with previous studies (xu etal., ).<br>subsequently, we transfected hek293t cells with eyfpsars wt and p. asp172asn expression vectors for 24hr and transfection efficiency was determined in parallel by counting transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy. transfections rates were 40.83.2% for sars wt and 39.81.1% for sars p. asp172asn, respectively. data to evaluate transfection efficiency were derived from three independent transfections.<br><br>after transfection, cells were harvested and total protein lysate as well as cytosolic and nuclear protein fractions were extracted. expression of ectopic wt and mutant sars proteins were analyzed by western blotting using monoclonal antigfp antibody (fig. a upper panel). the same membranes were then hybridized with antitubulin (fig. a middle panel) and antilamin antibodies (fig. a bottom panel). tubulin and lamin were used as control for cell fractionation and normalization.<br>quantification of six independent experiments revealed that expression of p. asp172asn was significantly reduced as compared with the wt in whole cell extracts as well as in the cytosolic fraction (&lt;0.005) (fig. b). in the nuclear fraction, signals were very weak and differences did not reach a level of statistical significance.<br><h3>3.7 impaired serineactivation of the sars p. asp172asn enzyme</h3><br> modeling of sars revealed that p. asp172 maps close to the active site of the protein (supp. fig. s3a) in the trnasynthetase class ii core domain (fig. c). although it is facing away from the active site, p. asp172 might influence sars aminoacylation activity because of its negative charge, which is lost upon mutation (p. asp172asn). aminoacylation is performed by arss in a twostep reaction: first, an ars binds an amino acid and atp to form an aminoacyladenylate (aaamp). at the same time, pyrophosphate (p2o7, ppi) is released. in the second step, the amino acid is transferred onto the 3 terminal adenosine of the trna that is to be charged and subsequently the charged trna and the amp molecule are released from the enzyme (schimmel &amp; soll, ). to understand whether mutant sars is still able to perform the first step of aminoacylation, we established a pyrophosphate release assay. as prerequisite wt and mutant (p. asp172asn and p. thr429ala) cdnas were cloned into pgex6p3. sars protein with a p. thr429ala mutation is unable to bind serine as this alteration affects a serine binding site (fig. c) and lacks enzymatic activity (fukui, hanaoka, &amp; kawahara, ). this protein was used as a negative control during the aminoacylation test.<br>the purified gst protein was used as an additional negative control. for each protein, activity measurements were performed at three different time points (0, 60, and 90min) (fig. c). the pyrophosphate release of the wt sars reached a maximum at 60min, and after 90min of incubation the enzyme still released approximately two thirds of the maximal amount of pyrophosphate as a byproduct of serine activation. firstly, this reduced rate of pyrophosphate production can be explained by entering of amp into the back reaction of amino acid activation. it was shown by rapaport, remy, kleinkauf, vater, and zamecnik () that this mechanism is an inherent part of the catalytic activities of arss and could prevent the buildup of enzymebound or free aminoacyl adenylates. secondly, substrate inhibition might cause the decrease in aminoacylation activity because seryladenylate canremain bound to the sars enzyme. during aminoacylation of alanyltrna synthetase (aars), the alanyladenylate product remains bound tightly to the enzyme and is only turnedover when trna is present in the reaction. in addition, pyrophosphate generated in the adenylation step substantially inhibits the initial rate of aminoacylation of trna in a dose dependent manner. the degree to which pyrophosphate inhibits a given reaction depends, inter alia, on the extent to which the reaction has progressed. however, the mechanism of this inhibition still needs to be established (wolfson &amp; uhlenbeck, ). remarkably, a highly significant loss of serineactivation was observed for the sars p. asp172asn mutant. at 60min, gstsars p. asp172asn released only 28% pyrophosphate as compared with the gstsars wt enzyme and even after 90min of incubation gstsars p. asp172asn still produced 51% less pyrophosphate than the wt enzyme at 60min. consistent with previous findings (xu etal., ), the gstsars p. thr429ala was inactive during the assay (fig. c). as expected, the gst protein did not show any pyrophosphate release (data not shown).<br><h3>3.8 compound heterozygous mutation in family 2<br></h3><br>as a result of whole genome sequencing, we found a compound heterozygous genotype of the gene in the affected individuals of family 2 (fig. b and d).<br>wars2 is a nucleusencoded tryptophanyltrna synthetase, which is imported into mitochondria. the protein contains an nterminal mitochondrial targeting signal, and a cterminal domain with tryptophantrna ligase activity (fig. d). furthermore, it is probably able to load trna(sec) with serine, which would result in a misacylated trna, lseryltrna(sec) that can be further converted into selenocysteinyltrna(sec). expression of was evaluated by rnaseq in different human brain regions relevant for learning and memory (supp. fig. s5).<br>the wars2 genotype we observed in the affected individuals comprises a frameshift mutation on the paternal allele and a missense change on the maternal allele. the mutations cosegregated with the disease in the family (supp. fig. s6 and supp. table s3). both were submitted to the public leiden open variation database 3.0 (). the frameshift mutation in exon 2 of the gene (chr1:119618996dela, nm_015836.3: c.325dela, np_056651: p. ser109alafs*15) leads to a premature stop codon and, given its location relative to the terminal exon 6, is most likely to cause nonsense mediated decay (nmd) (fig. d), resulting in a complete loss of a functional gene product from this allele. the change was not found in the various control panels used (see p.14)<br>the second change (chr1:119683231a&gt;c, nm_015836.3: c.37t&gt;g) (fig. d) was also absent in controls (see p.14) and is located in exon 1 and is present in the exac database (version 0.3) with an allelic frequency 0.003383. it affects an amino acid (np_056651: p. trp13gly) located in an nterminal mitochondrial sp. in order to determine putatively adverse functional effects of this alteration on the remaining wars2 allele, we first performed 3d modeling (project hope) of the p. trp13gly variant, which indicated that the introduced glycine, being smaller and less hydrophobic than the wt trp residue, indeed has an effect on wars2 protein structure and function. the size difference between the wt and mutant residue renders it likely that the mutant gly residue is not in the correct position to make the same hydrogen bonds as the original amino acid. in addition, the difference in hydrophobicity between trp and gly can affect the hydrogen bond formation as well.<br>this is important as p. trp13gly is located within the mitochondrial transit peptide. this peptide forms a special signal that is required to find the correct location of the protein in the cell. a mutation in this peptide might change or impair the recognition signal and therefore affect the correct localization of wars2. to evaluate this assumption , we took advantage of several publicly available and widely used softwares including predotar (score for wt: 0,69 and for p. trp13gly: 0,35), mitoprot ii (probability for wt: 0,7183and for p. trp13gly: 0,5184), slplocal (svm score for wt: 0,709, ri:1 and for p. trp13gly: 0,682, ri: 1), and targetp 1.1 (score for wt: 0.887, rc: 2 and for p. trp13gly: 0,869, rc: 2), all of which predicted that the amino acid substitution would reduce the import into the mitochondria, and thus result in a partial mislocalization of wars2 in the cells.<br><h3>3.9 impaired mitochondrial localization of the wars2 p. trp13gly protein</h3><br>to experimentally test the hypothesis that the p. trp13gly change is functionally relevant, we first performed immunofluorescence microscopy experiments, which revealed that wars2eyfp and p. trp13glywars2eyfp were present in the cytoplasm of cos7 cells, in dotlike structures. to investigate whether these punctuated structures represent mitochondria, we treated live cells with mitotracker, a redfluorescent dye that stains mitochondria. furthermore, its accumulation is dependent upon mitochondrial membrane potential (chazotte, ). upon treatment, most wars2wtpositive granules overlapped with the mitochondria staining, thus confirming previous findings (jorgensen, sogaard, rossing, martensen, &amp; justesen, ), whereas a partial reduction in the overlapping signal was observed for the p. trp13gly mutant (fig. a). this result was further substantiated by the results of a costaining experiment with the mitochondrial marker hsp60 (fig. b).<br>to confirm the localization of wars2 to the mitochondria and to further evaluate if p. trp13gly has a negative impact in this context, we performed subcellular fractionation to isolate mitochondria from hek293t cells transiently expressing wars2eyfp and p. trp13glywars2eyfp. protein lysates from mitochondrial and cytosolic fractions were then submitted to sds gel and western blot analysis. this revealed that both wt and mutant wars2 were enriched in the mitochondrial fraction. a specific antibody against phb1, a mitochondrial marker, was used to confirm the quality of the subcellular fractionation (supp. fig. s7 and fig. ). to determine if the p. trp13gly change, which affects the mitochondrial sp in wars2, could impair the protein translocation to the mitochondria, we quantified the amount of wt and mutant protein in the isolated mitochondrial fraction, using a panel of mitochondria specific proteins for normalization. this analysis revealed that the amount of p. trp13glywars2 in the mitochondria was significantly reduced as compared with the wt protein (fig. ae). western blot analysis of total protein lysates extracted in parallel, showed no significant difference between total amount of wars2 wt and p. trp13glywars2 (fig. f and g). the transfection efficiency was determined by counting transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy. transfections rates were 42.82.2% for wars2 wt and 40.81.3% for wars2 p. trp13gly, respectively. data were derived from three independent transfections. interestingly, by immunofluorescence analysis, using a specific antibody against sdha, a catalytic subunit of succinateubiquinone oxidoreductase, and part of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, we observed a marked decrease of sdha signal (supp. fig. s8) in cells overexpressing wt wars2 compared with cells overexpressing the mutant protein and control cells. western blot analysis performed on the mitochondrial fraction confirmed this observation: the amount of sdha was significantly reduced upon wt wars2 overexpression as compared with mutant wars2 (fig. a and h).<br><h2>4 discussion</h2><br>in this report,  <span style="color:red">we describe putatively id causing mutations in and</span>  <span style="color:red">in families with closely overlapping additional clinical features including moderate id,</span>  <span style="color:red">speech impairment,</span>  <span style="color:red">seizures,</span>  <span style="color:red">ataxia,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span> muscular weakness. the occurrence of ataxia is consistent with previous reports that implicate arss in the etiology of this particular feature (see e.g. (lee et al., )). moreover, muscular weakness was repeatedly observed in the context of trnarelated disorders in general or arsrelated conditions in particular, for example, charcotmarietooth (cmt) disease (mim# 607731) and others (see e.g. (abbott, francklyn, &amp; robeybond, ; bansagi etal., ; irobi, de jonghe, &amp; timmerman, ; mclaughlin etal., ), which also supports our conclusion that the phenotype in our families is caused by the dnaalterations we report here.<br>the gene products of both genes are involved in trnaaminoacylation and we could confirm that both are well expressed in tissues relevant for memory and learning in the mature brain. together with aimp1, which we have recently found to be implicated in id without neurodegeneration (iqbal etal., ), there are now at least three genes with a role in trnaaminoacylation that are apparently relevant for human cognition.<br>the gene product catalyzes the attachment of serine to trna(ser). moreover it is likely able to charge trna(sec) with serine, resulting in the misacylated trna lseryltrna(sec), which can be further converted into selenocysteinyltrna(sec). we found that the p. asp172asn alteration we identified leads to impaired serineactivation of the sars enzyme.<br>in the second family, whole genome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygous genotype in affected individuals, consisting of a deleterious frameshift mutation and a missense change (p. trp13gly) in the mitochondrial tryptophanyltrna synthetase encoding . we could show that the latter has a putative effect on structure and function of the gene product from the remaining allele and demonstrate impaired mitochondrial localization of the remaining wars2 p. trp13gly protein. this might in itself have only a subliminal effect, which when present in a heterozygous state, may not have significant downstream consequences. however, when paired with a deleterious alteration on the second allele, such as the frameshift mutation we found, the subliminally impaired function of the missense allele might not be sufficient to compensate and thus result in a pathogenic reduction in wars2 enzymatic activity. similar observations were made by sauter etal. (2015) who report that carriers of compound mutations show the strongest effects concerning dars2 solubility and activity, when missense mutations occur in combination with a splicing defect on the second allele.<br>interestingly, ectopic expression of wt wars2 in hek293t cells induced a significant reduction in the amount of sdha protein as compared with controls or to cells overexpressing the p. trp13gly variant of wars2. based on the canonical function of wars2, this might suggest a role for this protein in the translation of sdha, which would then be partially impaired in the mutant protein.  <span style="color:red">this is noteworthy,</span>  <span style="color:red">since homozygous mutations in the gene cause leigh syndrome and</span>  <span style="color:red">mitochondrial respiratory chain complex ii deficiency (mim# 256000,</span>  <span style="color:red">mim# 252011) in patients that present,</span>  <span style="color:red">among other features,</span>  <span style="color:red">ataxia,</span>  <span style="color:red">muscle weakness,</span>  <span style="color:red">cognitive impairment,</span>  <span style="color:red">and</span>  <span style="color:red">seizures.<br>we believe that wars2 p.</span> trp13gly is in fact a functional polymorphism (albert, ) that is uncovered by a loss of the gene product from the second allele. in this context it should also be mentioned that position 13 in the wars2 gene product can be affected also by one other alteration (p. trp13arg) but this is very rare (3/121412 alleles according to the exac database) and was not observed in a homozygous state. moreover, albeit p. trp13gly was found in 403 of the 60,706 individuals included in the exac database (url: ) to date (august 2016) even this variant was found to be homozygous only once. the functional relevance of the p. trp13gly alteration as such might be primarily due to its impact on the amino acid composition of the localization signal sequence in the gene product, which leads to a mislocalization of the otherwise functional protein. it is therefore conceivable that missense changes affecting the composition of this important molecular section in general might have a negative effect without changing the functional integrity of the affected protein per se (see e.g. also hu etal., ). this is interesting because the disease causing potential of such alterations might in many cases not be identified by the presently available prediction algorithms, so that in ngsbased mutation screening studies such polymorphisms are probably still being filtered out.<br>a recently generated targeted rat model supports our hypothesis: while, like in uncharacterized knockout mice (url: ), the deficient allele is embryonically lethal in a homozygous state (), heterozygous animals () appear normal. moreover, it has been shown that animals heterozygous () for the knockout allele and p. leu53phe, a common variant in rat strains that is associated with a 40% reduction in wars2 activity, revealed diminished cardiac angiogenesis and reduced coronary flow as compared with animals with compound heterozygosity for the wt allele and the p. leu53phe allele () (wang etal., ). this suggests that represents a compound hypomorph similar to the situation observed in our patients.<br>functionally the mutations we found in sars and wars2 might lead to a reduced amount of charged trna available for translation at the ribosomes, which in turn could lead to a reduced translation rate, especially of those proteins that contain high amounts of serine, selenocysteine or tryptophan, respectively. selenocysteine for example is an essential component of the 25 selenoproteins encoded in the human genome (lu &amp; holmgren, ). selenoproteins are involved in protein folding, degradation of misfolded membrane proteins, and control of cellular calcium homeostasis (andersen, ). interestingly, deletion of selenoprotein p (sepp1) in mice produces both neuronal and axonal degeneration as well as potentially reversible neurite changes in the developing brain (caito etal., ). neuronspecific ablation of selenoprotein expression causes a neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative phenotype in mice, affecting the cerebral cortex and the hippocampus, particularly the parvalbumin (pv)positive interneuron population (wirth etal., ). moreover,  <span style="color:red">loss of pv neurons is associated with some neuropsychiatric disorders,</span>  <span style="color:red">for example,</span>  <span style="color:red">autism spectrum disorders (sgado etal.,</span>  <span style="color:red">).<br>specifically with respect to sars p.</span>  <span style="color:red">asp172asn,</span> our overexpression experiments, which we carried out in hek293t cells, because of their high transfection efficiency and because they are commonly used to assess an impairment of localization in the mitochondria, showed that in comparison to the ectopic wt protein the level of ectopic p. asp172asn was significantly reduced in whole cell extracts as well as in the cytosolic fraction. as transfection rates for both were similar this is most likely due to the mutation, suggesting reduced protein stability of mutant sars, which is also in line with our 3d modeling results. intriguingly, the observed amounts of wt and mutant sars in the nuclear fraction were similar, indicating that while the mutation seems to affect the overall stability and function of the sars gene product, the nuclear transport properties seem to be unaffected. loss of sars or severe impairment of sars function might slow down overall translation rates during cellular processes that depend on fast and reliable protein translation (e.g., in axonal growth cones; reviewed by jung &amp; holt, ; swanger &amp; bassell, ) or synaptic processes involved in learning, memory processing, and memory storage as reviewed by bekinschtein etal. (), costamattioli, sonenberg, and richter (), and galbenari etal. (). similar disease mechanisms have been proposed for mutations within , which are associated with infantile hepatopathy (casey etal., ), and mutations within that cause recessive intermediate cmt disease type b (cmtrib) (mim# 613641) (mclaughlin etal., ) with a phenotype that does not only comprise peripheral neuropathy but also selfabusive behavior and developmental delay. finally, it is also noteworthy that in the presence of a tryptophanyltrna deficiency, neurodegenerative symptoms can be induced by tryptamine. tryptamine induces axonopathy and mitochondriopathy mimicking neurodegenerative diseases via tryptophanyltrna deficiency (paley, perry, &amp; sokolova,  <span style="color:red">).<br>regarding wars2,</span>  <span style="color:red">it is interesting to note that mutations in human mitochondrial arss are associated with various neurodegenerative diseases and</span>  <span style="color:red">that all other mitochondrial arss,</span>  <span style="color:red">were already found to be subject to pathologyrelated mutations (diodato,</span> ghezzi, &amp; tiranti, ; hallmann etal., ; konovalova &amp; tyynismaa, ; schwartzentruber etal., ; schwenzer, zoll, florentz, &amp; sissler, ; sofou etal., ; suzuki, nagao, &amp; suzuki, ). mitochondrial protein synthesis is central to the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation system (oxphos). why clinical consequences of mutations in essential genes are restricted to the brain is still unclear, however, it has been suggested before that, given the fundamental function of mitochondrial arss, a lossoffunction is incompatible with life but that low enzyme activity may be sufficient to allow uterine development yet still result in specific disorders during postnatal life (konovalova &amp; tyynismaa, ). the high demand of energy for the maintenance of brain functions makes the central nervous system particularly sensitive to disturbances in the (mitochondrial) oxphos and it is conceivable that cognitive functions, being the last to develop during evolution, suffer first from imbalances in the energy supply system. when present at crucial neurodevelopmental stages such disturbances could result in permanent damage, while other tissues or functions might not be affected, the residual wars2 activity being sufficient to cover the demand in these cases.<br>furthermore, synapses might be particularly vulnerable to imbalances in the cell or energy metabolism caused by either cytoplasmic or mitochondrial class i and class ii arss (najmabadi etal., ). as reviewed by valnegri, sala, and passafaro (), more than 50% of idrelated proteins are enriched in synaptic compartments and may be involved in synaptic plasticity, synapse formation and cytoskeleton rearrangement (see also ropers &amp; hamel, ).  <span style="color:red">histological data,</span>  <span style="color:red">which also show a correlation between the severity of id and</span>  <span style="color:red">the severity of dendritic spine malformations (valnegri etal.,</span>  <span style="color:red">),</span>  <span style="color:red">further corroborate the hypothesis that some features of id are caused by alterations in synaptic functions.</span> thus, for further experiments aimed at investigating a possible effect on synapse morphology neuronal cell lines or primary neurons might be advantageous.<br>interestingly, sars and wars2 also seem to interact directly in some cases, as an analysis using the string (, (szklarczyk etal., ), last accessed 07/2016) database showed. still, in which way this could be relevant in the context of the human brain remains to be investigated.<br>with , , and the previously implicated , a noncatalytic component of the multitrna synthetase complex and modulator of aminoacylation activity of cytoplasmic arginyltrna synthase rrs (iqbal etal., ) there are now at least three genes involved in trnaaminoacylation that play a role in the pathology of hereditary cognitive disorders. in this context, it is worthwhile mentioning that various trnamodifiers were already found to play a role in the etiology of id as well (see balke, kuss, &amp; muller, for review). it therefore seems that trnamodification and aminoacylation are emerging to be among the more prominent pathways contributing to the molecular background of human cognitive disorders and in conclusion, we would like to present the notion that not only a full but also a fully functional complement of trnas is vital for the development and maintenance of higher brain functions.<br><h2> acknowledgments</h2><br>we are very grateful to the affected individuals and their family for their participation in the study. we thank susanne freier and daniel mehnert for expert technical assistance. we also thank robert weissmann for excellent bioinformatics analyses. h. h. r., l. m., h. n., h. h., and k. k. participated in the gencodys consortium.<br><h2> disclosure statement</h2><br>the authors declare no conflict of interest.<br><h2></h2><br>please note: the publisher is not responsible for the content or functionality of any supporting information supplied by the authors. any queries (other than missing content) should be directed to the corresponding author for the article.<br><h2><br>references<br></h2><br><h2>citing literature</h2><h3>number of times cited according to crossref: 31</h3><br>june 2017<br>pages 621-636<br><h5><br><h2><br>additional links<br></h2><br><h3>about wiley online library</h3><br><h3>help &amp;
