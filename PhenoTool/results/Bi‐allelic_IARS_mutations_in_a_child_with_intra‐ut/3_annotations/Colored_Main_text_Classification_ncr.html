Whole exome sequencing was performed at the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) using the SeqCap EZ Exome version 3.0 capture kit (Roche NimbleGen, Madison WI) and the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. Sequencing data were aligned to the human reference genome using Novoalign (Novocraft Technologies, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia). Variants were called using the in house MPG genotype caller. Detected variants were annotated and filtered using PhenoDB (Baylor Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics) 10.<br><h3> Yeast complementation assays</h3> <br> To evaluate the functional consequence of the  variants identified in the patient described here we performed yeast complementation assays utilizing a pYY1 expression construct. Similar studies have successfully revealed the functional consequences of many disease associated aminoacyl tRNA synthetase mutations 4 and were recently employed to study the functional consequences of other  variants 9. Here, the endogenous yeast gene is deleted and the ability of wild type and mutant human  alleles to support yeast cell growth is used as a proxy for enzyme function. Detailed methods are described in the Appendix S1 (Supporting information).<br><h2> Results</h2> <br> <br> <h3> Case description</h3> <br> The proband is the third son of nonconsanguineous parents of Arab descent.

WES identified compound heterozygous variants in : c.2215C&gt:T, p. Arg739Cys and c.1667T&gt:C, p. Phe556Ser (NM_002161) with a low mean allele frequency in the ExAC database of ~60,000 exomes (2.47 and 0, respectively). The unaffected sisters did not carry these variants (Fig. 2a). Complementation studies in yeast demonstrated the  variants cause a loss of function effect on yeast viability (Fig. 3). Growth associated with the p. Phe556Ser variant was only visible after 4 days of incubation at 30degC, while growth associated with wild type  was visible after 2 days of incubation. Furthermore, the number and size of colonies associated with p. Phe556Ser IARS were visibly reduced even after 4 days of incubation. This indicates that p. F556S has impaired function  and is thus a hypomorphic allele. The p. Arg739Cys variant was unable to support any yeast cell growth at both 2 and 4 days of incubation consistent with p.

On physical exam there was a strikingly round face compared to trunk, increased fat in the genitalia area, as well as soft, translucent and hyper elastic skin with joint laxity (Fig. 1b). These findings may have been overlooked previously, or more prominent at an younger age. Reports on additional individuals with this condition will help determine whether this is a common feature that may assist in clinical diagnosis and point to a role of  in connective tissue development.<br>The subject had two novel  variants in trans. The variants were located within the catalytic and anticodon recognition domains and are conserved down to yeast (Fig. 2c,d). The c.2215C&gt:T, p. Arg739Cys variant is in a previously described tRNA binding site 12 and the c.1667T&gt:C, p. Phe556Ser variant is four residues upstream of a catalytic active site 13. We performed complementation studies in yeast using the human  gene. The  variants assessed affected yeast viability to a varying extent. The p. Phe556Ser variant had impaired function but did enable growth, however p. Arg739Cys was unable to support any yeast cell growth (Fig. 3). Therefore, similar to the previously reported cases, the proband has one null allele and one hypomorphic allele. <span style="color:lime" title="HPO: HP:0001396

Similarly, there are no reports on two hypomorphic alleles (compound heterozygous or homozygous). It is possible that such individuals will have a milder and less recognizable phenotype.<br>In summary, this report supports the association between bi allelic pathogenic variants in  and intra uterine growth delay and liver dysfunction with neonatal cholestasis. We expand the phenotype to include mild developmental delay, skin and joint laxity and hypervitaminosis D. Further reports on individuals with this condition will help define the clinical spectrum.<br><h2> Acknowledgements</h2> <br> We are thankful to the family for consenting to participate in this publication.
