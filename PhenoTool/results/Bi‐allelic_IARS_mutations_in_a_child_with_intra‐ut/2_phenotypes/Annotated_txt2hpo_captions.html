Effects of IARS variants on cell growth in yeast complementation assays. The p.Phe556Ser and p.Arg739Cys IARS variants cause severely depleted cell growth in yeast complementation assays. A haploid yeast strain deleted for endogenous ISL1 (with viability maintained by a URA3bearing plasmid harboring wildtype ISL1) was transformed with a pYY1 plasmid containing wildtype IARS, the indicated mutant form of IARS, or no insert (Empty). Cultures for each strain (labeled along the top) were grown for 2 days in liquid medium, diluted or left saturated (indicated along the left), spotted on solid medium containing 5FOA to select for spontaneous loss of the URA3bearing maintenance vector, and grown at 30C for either two days (top panel) or four days (bottom panel). The 1 and 2 annotations indicate the use of two independently generated mutant IARS expression constructs. Please note the weak growth of cells expressing p.Ph556Ser IARS after four days (compare the 1:10 dilutions of wildtype and p.Phe556Ser IARS in the bottom panel).
