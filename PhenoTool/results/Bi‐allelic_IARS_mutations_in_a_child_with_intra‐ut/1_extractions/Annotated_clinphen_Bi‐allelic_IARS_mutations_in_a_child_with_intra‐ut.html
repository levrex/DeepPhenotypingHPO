appropriate amino acid to trna to enable protein synthesis 1. all arss contain catalytic and anticodon recognition domains to catalyze the aminoacylation reactions specific for their cognate amino acids 2. some arss harbor non canonical domains with various activities including regulation of gene transcription and expression. in the past decade mutations in a growing number of arss were linked to human disease 3, 4. four human cytosolic arss have been implicated in autosomal dominant charcot-marie-tooth disease 2, 5-7 and mutations in mitochondrial arss cause a spectrum of mitochondrial disorders 8. recently, kopajtich et al. reported three individuals harboring bi allelic mutations in cytosolic isoleucyl trna synthetase () (mim: 600709). these individuals had a distinct syndrome of prenatal onset growth retardation, intellectual disability, and liver dysfunction 9. here, we report an additional subject with bi allelic missense substitutions in and overlapping clinical findings.

pregnancy was complicated by abnormal first trimester screening with 1:35 risk for down syndrome due to increased bhcg. anatomic ultrasound at 18 weeks was normal, but at 24 weeks decreased growth was noted. during the third trimester there was growth delay and oligohydramnios. he was delivered via spontaneous vaginal delivery at 37 weeks gestation. the birth weight was 1840 g ( = -2.52) and the head circumference (hc) was 29.7 cm ( = -2.6). the apgar scores were 9 and 10 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. he was admitted to the nicu for low birth weight and hypoglycemia (27 mg/dl) that resolved with feeding. during his admission he developed direct hyperbilirubinemia up to 7.5 mg/dl, increased alkaline phosphatase 1450 (u/l) and ggt 311 (u/l). he had abnormal liver enzymes got 200 (u/l), gpt 108 (u/l), hypoalbuminemia and hyperammonemia (139). he was treated with vitamin k and fresh frozen plasma because his blood did not clot and inr was not measurable, with improvement in the inr (1.5) that later on normalized. treatment with ursodeoxycholic acid was initiated and he received pregestimil per nasogastric (ng) tube.  <span style="color:red">he had a normal echocardiogram.</span>  <span style="color:red">on abdominal us the liver was normal in size and</span>  <span style="color:red">texture.</span>  <span style="color:red">there was a duplicated collecting system on the left

performed at the age of 1 month (fig. 1a). the lobular architecture was preserved, with bile stasis in hepatocytes. fibrosis with new vessel formation was seen in portal spaces. no bile duct was traced in eight portal spaces. bile ductular proliferation was seen and demonstrated by immunostain for cytokeratin (ck). gradually the jaundice resolved and the liver enzymes normalized. he had increased levels of 25 hydroxy vitamin d (up to 253 nmol/l) with normal pth levels of unknown cause. he received routine supplements until 12 months of age (400 units daily). after discontinuation of supplements, levels decreased to the high normal range (fig. s1). repeated zinc levels were within normal range. during his nicu admission there was one episode of urinary tract infection with .. at 1 year, his length, weight and hc measured at -5 sd. on examination he had abnormal fat distribution with a round face, full cheeks and increased fat in the genitalia area. he had joint hyperlaxity and his skin was hyper elastic, doughy like and transparent (fig. 1b). he received formula supplements via ng tube until the age of 4 years. he is treated with growth hormone (gh) since the age of 19 months for gh resistance (abnormal igf1 generation test), potentially secondary to his liver dysfunction and poor nutrition status. at the age of 4 years the height and length were within normal range

underwent a basic metabolic evaluation that did not reveal a diagnosis. . wes identified compound heterozygous variants in : c.2215c&gt:t, p. arg739cys and c.1667t&gt:c, p. phe556ser (nm_002161) with a low mean allele frequency in the exac database of ~60,000 exomes (2.47 and 0, respectively). the unaffected sisters did not carry these variants (fig. 2a). complementation studies in yeast demonstrated the variants cause a loss of function effect on yeast viability (fig. 3). growth associated with the p. phe556ser variant was only visible after 4 days of incubation at 30degc, while growth associated with wild type was visible after 2 days of incubation. furthermore, the number and size of colonies associated with p. phe556ser iars were visibly reduced even after 4 days of incubation. this indicates that p. f556s has impaired function and is thus a hypomorphic allele. the p. arg739cys variant was unable to support any yeast cell growth at both 2 and 4 days of incubation consistent with p. arg739cys resulting in a functional null allele.<br><h2> discussion</h2> this report supports the association between bi allelic pathogenic variants in and a distinct syndrome characterized by intra uterine growth delay, liver dysfunction, and neurodevelopmental disabilities. significant growth delay is a consistent finding in all the reported subjects as well as the potentially equivalent disorder seen in cattle 11. the cause for growth delay is unknown and might improve with age and / or gh therapy. one subject was reported to have gh deficiency, however, here we report gh resistance. liver dysfunction and abnormal liver pathology was seen in two previously reported patients and only one presented with neonatal cholestasis. that individual also carried a variant of uncertain significance in (mim: 603201).  <span style="color:red">the subject reported here had a similar presentation with neonatal liver failure and</span>  <span style="color:red">cholestasis.</span>  <span style="color:red">we did not identify any rare variants in genes related to neonatal cholestasis,</span>  <span style="color:red">supporting the role of in this presentation.</span> here, the liver biopsy was performed at the age of 1 month compared to 1-2 years in previously reported cases. interestingly, portal tract fibrosis and bile ductular proliferation (positive ck19) was already observed. steatosis was not seen and might be a late manifestation. there was bile ducts paucity which is seen in very few conditions such as congenital sclerosing cholangitis, alagille syndrome (mim: 118450), drug induced liver injury and the vanishing bile duct syndrome. here, we add an additional condition that may present this way and also associated with immunostain positive for cholangiolar proliferation. in contrast to the previously reported cases, development was normal up to the age of 3 years. at 4 years there is evidence of mild developmental delay based on cat/clams scores but he attends a regular preschool. this supports a variable neurodevelopmental outcome in individuals with this disorder and potentially typical development and iq in some of the cases. this may depend on the severity of the variants and enzyme residual activity. recurrent infections, low zinc levels and clinical improvement with zinc supplements were reported in the previous cases. however, in this case zinc levels were normal on repeated tests and there was a single bacterial infection. interestingly, 25 hydroxy vitamin d levels were high in spite of liver failure, however the levels decreased after discontinuation of routine supplements and the etiology is not clear. on physical exam there was a strikingly round face compared to trunk, increased fat in the genitalia area, as well as soft, translucent and hyper elastic skin with joint laxity (fig. 1b). these findings may have been overlooked previously, or more prominent at an younger age. reports on additional individuals with this condition will help determine whether this is a common feature that may assist in clinical diagnosis and point to a role of in connective tissue development.<br>the subject had two novel variants in trans. the variants were located within the catalytic and anticodon recognition domains and are conserved down to yeast (fig. 2c,d). the c.2215c&gt:t, p. arg739cys variant is in a previously described trna binding site 12 and the c.1667t&gt:c, p. phe556ser variant is four residues upstream of a catalytic active site 13. we performed complementation studies in yeast using the human gene. the variants assessed affected yeast viability to a varying extent. the p. phe556ser variant had impaired function but did enable growth, however p. arg739cys was unable to support any yeast cell growth (fig. 3). therefore, similar to the previously reported cases, the proband has one null allele and one hypomorphic allele. there are currently no reports of individuals with two null alleles, potentially because these will result in early lethality. similarly, there are no reports on two hypomorphic alleles (compound heterozygous or homozygous). it is possible that such individuals will have a milder and less recognizable phenotype.<br>in summary, this report supports the association between bi allelic pathogenic variants in and intra uterine growth delay and liver dysfunction with neonatal cholestasis. we expand the phenotype to include mild developmental delay, skin and joint laxity and hypervitaminosis d. further reports on individuals with this condition will help define the clinical spectrum.<br><h2> acknowledgements</h2> <br>please note: the publisher is not responsible for the content or
