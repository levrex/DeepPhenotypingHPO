Recently, Kopajtich et al.. reported three individuals harboring bi allelic mutations in cytosolic isoleucyl tRNA synthetase () (MIM: 600709).. These individuals had a distinct syndrome of prenatal onset growth retardation, intellectual disability, and liver dysfunction 9.. Here, we report an additional subject with bi allelic missense substitutions in  and overlapping clinical findings..

174|HP:0001410|FP|Decreased liver function|Therefore, similar to the previously reported cases, the proband has one null allele and one hypomorphic allele.. There are currently no reports of individuals with two null alleles, potentially because these will result in early lethality.. Similarly, there are no reports on two hypomorphic alleles (compound heterozygous or homozygous).. It is possible that such individuals will have a milder and less recognizable phenotype.<br>In summary, this report supports the association between bi allelic pathogenic variants in  and intra uterine growth delay and liver dysfunction with neonatal cholestasis.. We expand the phenotype to include mild developmental delay, skin and joint laxity and hypervitaminosis D.
