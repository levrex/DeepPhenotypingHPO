50|HP:0001510|TP|Growth delay|Therefore, similar to the previously reported cases, the proband has one null allele and one hypomorphic allele.. There are currently no reports of individuals with two null alleles, potentially because these will result in early lethality.. Similarly, there are no reports on two hypomorphic alleles (compound heterozygous or homozygous).. It is possible that such individuals will have a milder and less recognizable phenotype.<br>In summary, this report supports the association between bi allelic pathogenic variants in  and intra uterine growth delay and liver dysfunction with neonatal cholestasis..

171|HP:0001410|FP|Decreased liver function|Therefore, similar to the previously reported cases, the proband has one null allele and one hypomorphic allele.. There are currently no reports of individuals with two null alleles, potentially because these will result in early lethality.. Similarly, there are no reports on two hypomorphic alleles (compound heterozygous or homozygous).. It is possible that such individuals will have a milder and less recognizable phenotype.<br>In summary, this report supports the association between bi allelic pathogenic variants in  and intra uterine growth delay and liver dysfunction with neonatal cholestasis.. We expand the phenotype to include mild developmental delay, skin and joint laxity and hypervitaminosis D.
