The p.Phe556Ser and p.Arg739Cys IARS variants cause severely depleted cell growth in yeast complementation assays.. A haploid yeast strain deleted for endogenous ISL1 (with viability maintained by a URA3-bearing plasmid harboring wild-type ISL1) was transformed with a pYY1 plasmid containing wild-type IARS, the indicated mutant form of IARS, or no insert ('Empty').. Cultures for each strain (labeled along the top) were grown for 2 days in liquid medium, diluted or left saturated (indicated along the left), spotted on solid medium containing 5-FOA to select for spontaneous loss of the URA3-bearing maintenance vector, and grown at 30degC for either two days (top panel) or four days (bottom panel).|30.0|set()|HP:0012828|21.0|The p.Phe556Ser and p.Arg739Cys IARS variants cause severely depleted cell growth in yeast complementation assays.|['Severe']|0.0|None|0.0|1|Captions|15.0
