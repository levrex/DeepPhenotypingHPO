A haploid yeast strain deleted for endogenous ISL1 (with viability maintained by a URA3-bearing plasmid harboring wild-type ISL1) was transformed with a pYY1 plasmid containing wild-type IARS, the indicated mutant form of IARS, or no insert ('Empty').. Cultures for each strain (labeled along the top) were grown for 2 days in liquid medium, diluted or left saturated (indicated along the left), spotted on solid medium containing 5-FOA to select for spontaneous loss of the URA3-bearing maintenance vector, and grown at 30degC for either two days (top panel) or four days (bottom panel).. The '1' and '2' annotations indicate the use of two independently generated mutant IARS expression constructs.. Please note the weak growth of cells expressing p.Ph556Ser IARS after four days (compare the 1:10 dilutions of wild-type and p.Phe556Ser IARS in the bottom panel).. Entity3.
