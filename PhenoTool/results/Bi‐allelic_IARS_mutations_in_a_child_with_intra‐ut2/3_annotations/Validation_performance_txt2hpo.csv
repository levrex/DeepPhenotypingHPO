There are currently no reports of individuals with two null alleles, potentially because these will result in early lethality.. Similarly, there are no reports on two hypomorphic alleles (compound heterozygous or homozygous).. It is possible that such individuals will have a milder and less recognizable phenotype.<br>In summary, this report supports the association between bi allelic pathogenic variants in  and intra uterine growth delay and liver dysfunction with neonatal cholestasis..

There was bile ducts paucity which is seen in very few conditions such as congenital sclerosing cholangitis, Alagille syndrome (MIM: 118450), drug induced liver injury and the vanishing bile duct syndrome..
