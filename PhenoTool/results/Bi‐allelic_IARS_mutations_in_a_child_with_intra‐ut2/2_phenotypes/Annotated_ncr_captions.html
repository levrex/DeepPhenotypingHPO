The two unaffected sisters did not carry both variants. (b) IARS protein domains and location of the missense substitutions. (c) Conservation down to yeast and previously described catalytic active site 13 and tRNA binding site 12. Entity2 Effects of IARS variants on cell growth in yeast complementation assays. The p.Phe556Ser and p.Arg739Cys IARS variants cause severely depleted cell growth in yeast complementation assays. A haploid yeast strain deleted for endogenous ISL1 (with viability maintained by a URA3-bearing plasmid harboring wild-type ISL1) was transformed with a pYY1 plasmid containing wild-type IARS, the indicated mutant form of IARS, or no insert ('Empty'). Cultures for each strain (labeled along the top) were grown for 2 days in liquid medium, diluted or left saturated (indicated along the left), spotted on solid medium containing 5-FOA to select for spontaneous loss of the URA3-bearing maintenance vector, and grown at 30degC for either two days (top panel) or four days (bottom panel). The '1' and '2' annotations indicate the use of two independently generated mutant IARS expression constructs. Please note the  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0001510
