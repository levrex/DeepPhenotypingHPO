SECTION: Abstract" >developmental delay</span> , skin hyper elasticity, and hypervitaminosis D.<br>Aminoacyl tRNA synthetases (ARSs) are ubiquitously expressed, highly conserved enzymes involved in attaching the appropriate amino acid to tRNA to enable protein synthesis 1. All ARSs contain catalytic and anticodon recognition domains to catalyze the aminoacylation reactions specific for their cognate amino acids 2. Some ARSs harbor non canonical domains with various activities including regulation of gene transcription and expression. In the past decade mutations in a growing number of ARSs were linked to human disease 3, 4. Four human cytosolic ARSs have been implicated in autosomal dominant Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 2, 5-7 and mutations in mitochondrial ARSs cause a spectrum of mitochondrial disorders 8. Recently, Kopajtich et al. reported three individuals harboring bi allelic mutations in cytosolic isoleucyl tRNA synthetase () (MIM: 600709).

Whole exome sequencing was performed at the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) using the SeqCap EZ Exome version 3.0 capture kit (Roche NimbleGen, Madison WI) and the Illumina HiSeq2500 platform. Sequencing data were aligned to the human reference genome using Novoalign (Novocraft Technologies, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia). Variants were called using the in house MPG genotype caller. Detected variants were annotated and filtered using PhenoDB (Baylor Hopkins Center for Mendelian Genomics) 10.<br><h3> Yeast complementation assays</h3> <br> To evaluate the functional consequence of the  variants identified in the patient described here we performed yeast complementation assays utilizing a pYY1 expression construct. Similar studies have successfully revealed the functional consequences of many disease associated aminoacyl tRNA synthetase mutations 4 and were recently employed to study the functional consequences of other  variants 9. Here, the endogenous yeast gene is deleted and the ability of wild type and mutant human  alleles to support yeast cell growth is used as a proxy for enzyme function. Detailed methods are described in the Appendix S1 (Supporting information).<br><h2> Results</h2> <br> <br> <h3> Case description</h3> <br> The proband is the third son of nonconsanguineous parents of Arab descent. The pregnancy was complicated by abnormal first trimester screening with 1:35 risk for Down syndrome due to increased bHCG.

Complementation studies in yeast demonstrated the  variants cause a loss of function effect on yeast viability (Fig. 3). Growth associated with the p. Phe556Ser variant was only visible after 4 days of incubation at 30degC, while growth associated with wild type  was visible after 2 days of incubation. Furthermore, the number and size of colonies associated with p. Phe556Ser IARS were visibly reduced even after 4 days of incubation. This indicates that p. F556S has impaired function  and is thus a hypomorphic allele. The p. Arg739Cys variant was unable to support any yeast cell growth at both 2 and 4 days of incubation consistent with p. Arg739Cys resulting in a functional null allele.<br><h2> Discussion</h2> <br> This report supports the association between bi allelic pathogenic variants in  and a distinct syndrome characterized by intra uterine  <span style="color:red" title="HPO: HP:0001510

There are currently no reports of individuals with two null alleles, potentially because these will result in early lethality. Similarly, there are no reports on two hypomorphic alleles (compound heterozygous or homozygous).
