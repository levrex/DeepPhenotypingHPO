SARS-CoV-2 detected on nose and throat swab. b: Chest radiograph day+16 showing significant progression of bilateral consolidative opacities, worse in the lower zones. Aspergillus fumigatus complex isolated from ETT, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA detected by PCR on ETT sample. c: Chest radiograph on day+21 showing increased confluent right lung consolidation and persistent focal nodular consolidation in the left mid to lower zones. Voriconazole treatment day+1. d: Chest radiograph on day+27 showing overall improvement.
