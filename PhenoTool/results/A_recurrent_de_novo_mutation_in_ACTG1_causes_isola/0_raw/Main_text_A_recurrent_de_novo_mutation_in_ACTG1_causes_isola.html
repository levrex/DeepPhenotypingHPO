Bilateral OC is primarily genetically determined and shows marked locus heterogeneity. Wholeexome sequencing (WES) was used to analyze 12 trios (child affected with OC and both unaffected parents). This identified de novo mutations in 10 different genes in eight probands. Three of these genes encoded proteins associated with actin cytoskeleton dynamics: , , and . Probandonly WES identified a second unrelated individual with isolated OC carrying the same  allele, encoding p.(Pro70Leu). Both individuals have normal neurodevelopment with no extraocular signs of BaraitserWinter syndrome. We found this mutant protein to be incapable of incorporation into Factin. The  and  variants each resulted in only minor disturbance of actin interactions, and no further plausibly causative variants were identified in these genes on resequencing 380 unrelated individuals with OC.<br>Ocular coloboma (OC) is a closure defect affecting epithelial tissues in the embryonic optic fissure. OC accounts for 11% of childhood blindness and has a birth prevalence of 0.00020.0005 (Morrison etal., ; Shah etal., ) and most commonly presents as the absence of iris and/or retina in the inferonasal quadrant of the eye (Nakamura, Diehl, &amp; Mohney, ). OC often cooccurs with ipsi and/or contralateral microphthalmia (small eye) or contralateral anophthalmia (absent eye), suggesting that these structural eye defects can represent a phenotypic continuum (Morrison etal., ). Many of the known OC loci encode transcription factors or signaling molecules that drive the growth of the optic cup (Chow &amp; Lang, ; Zagozewski, Zhang, &amp; Eisenstat, ), suggesting growth failure as a mechanism for OC occurrence, where fusioncompetent fissure margin cannot appose. Failure of epithelial fusion is another obvious mechanism, although our knowledge of the genes and pathways required for this process is limited (Brown etal., ). OC is proving to be genetically heterogeneous (Williamson &amp; FitzPatrick, ) with no individual locus accounting for more than 3% of cases, and the majority of nonsyndromal OCaffected individuals (&gt;70%) have no identified genetic cause. Wholeexome sequencing (WES) within the rare diseases component of the UK10K project () has been successful in identifying causative loci in families with OC in  (, MIM# 606608) (Williamson etal., ),  (MIM# 604537) (Rainger etal., ), and  (MIM# 601723) (Liu etal., ).<br>Here, we report WES on 12 trios, each comprising one affected individual with isolated OC and both unaffected parents. In three of these trios, there was a wider family history of eye malformation that would be compatible with nonpenetrance in the intervening parent. DeNovoGear analysis (Ramu etal., ), together with a maximum minor allele frequency in ExAC of &lt;10, was used to identify candidate de novo mutations (DNM) among all technically robust variant calls in the affected child. Following review and Sanger sequence validation, 10 heterozygous de novo, ultrarare, plausibly disruptive variants were confirmed in 10 different genes from eight of the trios surveyed (Fig. , and summarized in Supp. Table S1 and Supp. Fig. S1 and have been deposited in the DECIPHER database []). Each trio was also screened for plausibly pathogenic homozygous or compound heterozygous variants in known developmental disorder genes. In proband COL5103597, a causative homozygous lossoffunction mutation was identified in , which has been reported separately (Chandra etal., ), and no DNM were identified in this trio. No other plausible autosomalrecessive genotypes were identified in the other trios.<br>The DNM identified in  (NM_001199954.1; MIM# 102560) in COL5231458 (family 12; c.209C&gt;T (p.(Pro70Leu), RNA not analyzed)) represented a strong candidate because DNM in the ubiquitous cytoplasmic actins (encoded by  and ) cause BaraitserWinter syndrome (BWS) with OC as a prominent feature (MIM# 243310 and 614583) (Di Donato etal., ; Riviere etal., ). Review of the WES data from the remaining UK10K OC probands identified another individual, COL5103624 (family 1,135) with the identical DNM (c.209 C&gt;T (p.(Pro70Leu), RNA not analyzed)). Clinical review confirmed that both probands had bilateral iridochorioretinal OC, with no involvement of the optic nerve and no evidence of the neurological and neurodevelopmental impairments that typify BWS. Neither had hearing loss. Individual COL5103624 had mild bilateral ptosis. In family 1,135, the mother did not carry the mutation, and the father was unavailable for testing.<br>ATP binding to actin, and subsequent hydrolysis to ADP, is coupled to conformational changes in actin monomers that appear to be essential for filament dynamics (Otterbein, Graceffa, &amp; Dominguez, ) and thus actin turnover during dynamic cytoskeletal remodeling. Actin monomers have four subdomains, structurally organized so that each presents a surface interface, and arranged such that they converge around the centrally bound nucleotide. The Pro70 residue in ACTG1 is positioned Nterminal to the previously reported BWS mutations (Fig. A), and is immediately adjacent to the nucleotidebinding domain of the actin monomer, in a loop (ProThr) that connects the COOHterminal end of subdomain 2 to subdomain 1. This loop undergoes conformational reorganization upon ATP hydrolysis, where a 10 rotation of subdomain 2 occurs, which in turn induces changes to interdomain interactions that affect the orientation of subdomain 4. In combination, these are predicted to have major effects on the overall structure and stability of each actinADP polymer (Otterbein etal., ). A severe destabilizing effect of the mutant Leu70 amino acid change to the protein was predicted using FoldX (Schymkowitz etal., ), with a difference in free energy of folding (G) between mutant and wild type (WT), of 6.31 kcal/mol in the ADPbound actin crystal structure, and G 7.4 kcal/mol in the ATPbound actin crystal structure (Fig. B). Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were derived from F0 embryos following CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create homozygous p. Pro70Leu lines (Supp. Fig. S2). Immunofluorescence showed a marked reduction of mutant ACTG1 in filamentous Factin (Fig.C) compared with MEFs from WT littermate control embryos. We then created tetracyclin (TET)inducible HEK293 cell lines expressing either mutant (Leu70) or WT ACTG1 tagged with Nterminal eGFP. Again, we observed reduced incorporation of Leu70 ACTG1 into Factin (Supp. Fig. S2b), whereas cosedimentation assays of these cells also showed a 50% reduction of Leu70 ACTG1 in the Gactin phase compared with WT (Fig. D). In all cell types examined, endogenous ACTB and ACTG1 appeared to be unaffected (Fig. C and D; Supp. Fig. S2c). Western blotting and semiquantitative mass spectrometry on ACTG1GFP immunoprecipitates from these HEK293 lines showed a marked reduction in the recovery of established actinbinding partners for Leu70 ACTG1 (Fig. E; Supp. TableS2).<br>Individual COL5061742 (family 7) had a DNM in  (NM_001242397.1; MIM# 610932; c.1045 C&gt;T; (p.(Pro349Ser), RNA not analyzed) that encodes Twinfillin1. However, the identification of a plausible DNM in this family is difficult to reconcile with the presence of an affected thirddegree maternal relative (Fig. ), unless the microphthalmia in this individual is coincidental. The eye phenotype of this relative is detailed as one smaller eye and low vision, but unfortunately more detailed clinical information or DNA were not available. Twinfilins are highly conserved ubiquitous actinbinding proteins that influence actin polymerization by forming 1:1 complexes with ADPactin monomers to moderate Factin filament assembly (Palmgren, Vartiainen, &amp; Lappalainen, ). Twf1 also influences the depolymerization and severing of actin filaments (Johnston, Collins, &amp; Goode, ; Moseley etal., ). The Twinfilin1 p.(Pro349Ser) substitution is located at the Cterminal tail region, out with the canonical actin interaction ADFH domains (Fig. A). This region was implicated in determining binding affinity to Factin, and complete deletion of the Cterminal tail significantly reduces barbedend capping activity (Paavilainen et al., ). In addition, the yeast Twinfilin tail region alone can bind Factin, and contributes to the binding of the fulllength protein, whereas loss of the tail region significantly affects Factin depolymerization in vitro (Johnston etal., ). TETinducible HEK293 cells expressing the WT and mutant Twinfilin1 failed to identify any significant proteinprotein interaction differences using immunoprecipitation with mass spectrometry (Supp. Table S2), and cosedimentation assays showed no differences in F/Gactin phase distributions. However, transient transfection of FLAGtagged, WT ACTG1 into these HEK293 cells showed slightly increased binding of variant Twinfilin1 to ACTG1, compared with WT TWF1 (Supp. Fig. S2D).<br>Individual COL5001071 (family 1) was found to have a DNM c.1823 A&gt;G; (p.(Asn608Ser), RNA not analyzed) in  (NM_002298.4; MIM# 153430) that encodes LCP1 (or Lplastin/plastin2), a conserved Factin filament crosslinking protein of the plastin family found in structures involved in cell adhesion, motility, and invasion, such as focal adhesions, membrane ruffles, and cell projections (Janji etal., ). LCP1 contains two actinbinding domains, and the p.(Asn608Ser) variant is located within the fourth of four calponin homology domains, in the second actinbinding domain (Fig. A). The variant was not predicted to affect LCP1 protein stability by in silico analysis but structural modeling predicts this residue to be on the surface of the protein (Supp. Fig. S2e). The variant was assessed using TETinducible HEK293 cells expressing WT and mutant versions of GFPtagged LCP1. We did not observe any reduction of protein stability (not shown), and both versions strongly associated with actin, but no clear differences in binding were observed by mass spectrometry. Cosedimentation analysis revealed these cells had increased signal in the Factin phase compared with WT (Supp. Fig. S2e). This may indicate abnormal LCP1actin interactions or increased Factin stability in an LCP1Ser608 containing cellular environment.<br>Targeted resequencing of 380 affected individuals with OC revealed no further plausible causative variants in any of the DNM genes identified here. All alleles, with the exception of the variants in  (MIM# 613257) and  (MIM# 608561), had ExAC allele frequencies of zero (Supp. Table S1). Using established online tools (SIFT [] and Polyphen2 []) to assess the biochemical impact of the encoded amino acid substitutions, only the  (MIM# 606279) DNM c.2009A&gt;G; p.(Asp670Gly) was predicted to encode a possibly damaging substitution (Supp. Table S1). ABI3BP has two fibronectin type II domains, but a role for this protein in development has not been firmly established. A recent  knockout mouse study revealed no overt phenotype (Yang etal., ); however, the  locus has been associated with optic disk morphology in a metaanalysis GWAS study (Springelkamp etal., ). None of the other genes have been implicated in developmental eye disorders, and no ocular phenotypes have been reported in mouse knockout models for their orthologues.<br>This work strongly supports a causative role for a recurrent de novo nonsynonymous variant affecting  in human coloboma, although its precise role in eye development requires further investigation. It was remarkable that two other actininteracting proteins were implicated from the DNM screen; however, the clinical and biochemical evidence for causation is significantly less compelling, and these variants cannot currently be considered pathogenic. Triobased genomewide sequence analysis shows promise in identifying novel genetic causes and genetic mechanisms for OC, but a significantly larger number of families have to be analyzed to determine the true number of diseaseassociated loci for this important eye malformation.<br>All datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are included within the article and the Supp. files: Table S1, Table S2, Figure S1, Figure S2, Figure S2 Legend, and Supp. Materials and Methods.
