transaminitis and cholestasis. his parents were first cousins. two older brothers and a sister were well. the patient suffered from loose stools from early infancy which became more troublesome and persistent from five years old with ten bloody motions a day. repeated endoscopies showed persistent pancolitis, which was refractory to mesalazine, corticosteroids, azathioprine, sirolimus and anti-tnf (adalimumab) therapy, but has improved recently with subcutaneous methotrexate. whole genome sequencing revealed a novel pathogenic missense variant (c.290a &gt: g) in the cytosolic isoleucyl-trna synthetase gene, leading to an amino acid substitution (p. asp97gly). pathogenic variants in other genes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) () were excluded. cytokine assays demonstrated markedly elevated il-2, il-5, il-13, il-9 and il-10 by the patient's cd4 t-cells, while il-17a, il-17f, ifnb were lower, and tnfa not significantly different when compared to healthy controls.<br> this case report provides evidence that recessive mutations in cytosolic isoleucyl-trna synthetase are a novel monogenic cause of ibd, which should be considered, particularly in infants and children with a history of neonatal hepatitis and very early-onset ibd poorly responsive to treatment.<br>key words: inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, gene, cytosolic isoleucine trna

evidence for a novel monogenic cause of inflammatory bowel disease that should be considered, particularly in patients with very early-onset, poor response to treatment and a history of neonatal hepatitis.<br><h5>introduction</h5>  <span style="color:red">aminoacyl trna synthetases/ligases (arss) are a group of 20 ubiquitously expressed,</span>  <span style="color:red">highly conserved

isoleucyl-trna synthetase.<br>in view of the very early-onset of the disease and its poor response to immunosuppres-sive medication, an underlying genetic cause was considered. whole genome sequencing performed as part of the united kingdom 100000 genome project revealed a homozygous c.290a &gt: g, p.(asp97gly) variant in cytosolic iars (encoded by iars1, nm_013417). parents were both heterozygous as were two unaffected siblings with the other unaffected sibling wild type. the variant was absent in the gnomad database of about 140000 controls and scored by predictors (mutationtaster 0.99: cadd score 32) to be pathogenic. the aspartic acid residue at this position is conserved to and the variant lies in the ilers core domain, where other disease causing variants have been identified. variants in other genes associated with ibd () were screened and no potentially pathogenic variants were found.<br> immune phenotyping was determined by flow cytometry. mucosal-associated invariant t-cells cell and natural killer cell frequencies were reduced, comprising &lt: 0.2 and 1% of lymphocytes, respectively (range: 1%-15%). greater than 60% of the patient's cd4 and cd8 t cells were of a naive phenotype, reflecting the young age of the patient. t-cells, total b-cells as well as b-cell subsets (transitional, naive, memory, class switching) were within normal range. release of th1, th2, th17 and treg pathway cytokines (il-2, il-4, il-5, il-9, il-10, il-13, il-17a, il-17f, tnfa and ifnb) that may be deranged in ibd were assayed by cytometric bead array (becton dickinson) after 5-d stimulation of purified memory cd4+ t cells with anti-cd2/cd3/cd28 monoclonal antibodies. secretion of some inflammatory (il-2, il-5, il-13, il-9) and immune regulatory (il-10) cytokines by the patient memory cd4 t-cells was markedly elevated, while il-17a, il-17f, ifnb were lower and tnfa not significantly different compared to healthy donors (figure 1c).<br> this research was made possible
