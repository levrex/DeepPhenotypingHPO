ARS deficiencies localized to the mitochondria have been known for 40 years and classically present with lactic acidosis, encephalopathy, failure to thrive and global developmental delay.. Clinical features of cytosolic ARS deficiency are more variable..

The high IL-10 level is in keeping with an ineffectual compensatory Treg response rather than a defect in this pathway..

Supportive evidence from additional cases and functional enzyme assays would be helpful in definitively confirming the role of the  gene in very early-onset IBD.. Assays are unfortunately not currently available.. This case report will hopefully lead to additional patients with very early-onset IBD due to variants in the  gene being reported by other clinicians.<br>. ARSs may be associated with T-cell dysfunction as seen in our patient, but the lack of improvement with most immunosuppressant drugs suggests that other inflammatory pathways are involved..
