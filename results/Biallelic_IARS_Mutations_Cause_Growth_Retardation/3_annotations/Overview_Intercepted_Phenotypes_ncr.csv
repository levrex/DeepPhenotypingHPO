Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) catalyze the aminoacylation of tRNAs by their cognate amino acid, linking amino acids with the correct nucleotide triplets and ensuring the correct transformation of the genetic code to the protein level.. Editing activities of ARSs further increase translation fidelity by preventing misacylation of tRNAs with non-cognate amino acids.. In mammals, ARSs can be distinguished by their cytoplasmatic or mitochondrial localization, with only two ARS in both compartments (GARS and KARS)..

To evaluate the functional relevance of identified  IARS  variants, we made use of a Tet-Off yeast model.. In the TET-ILS1 strain, expression of  ILS1 , the  Saccharomyces cerevisiae  ortholog of human  IARS , can be negatively regulated by addition of doxycycline to the growth medium.. The strain shows normal growth under standard conditions (Figure 2).. Reduced expression of  ILS1  resulted in considerable growth impairment: however, this phenotype was fully rescued by expression of the human wild-type  IARS  cDNA (Figure 2, first two lines) providing an in vivo assay to evaluate mutant alleles.. IARS  cDNAs carrying the different variants were cloned into the low-copy vector pYX122 (Novagen) and growth was compared to that of cells transformed with a wild-type copy of  IARS  or with the empty vector.<br>.

To gain further insight into the expression pattern of  IARS  and its role for embryonic development, we undertook in situ hybridization and morpholino (MO) knockdown of  iars  in zebrafish.. Iars is conserved in zebrafish and shares 74% homology to the human protein.. The expression of  iars  is ubiquitous in zebrafish during early embryonic development..

Lethality rate was decreased to 41% (n = 93) by addition of human  IARS  mRNA, confirming the MO targeting exon 18 specificity and, at the same time, suggesting an evolutionarily conserved role for  iars  in embryonic development.. As in yeast, zinc treatment did not result in a phenotypic rescue (data not shown).. Overall the experiments performed in this animal model suggest an important role for Iars in embryogenesis.. Downregulation of  iars  causes high lethality, with surviving embryos exhibiting a severe and consistent brain phenotype and a shortening of the body axis reminiscent of the human phenotype.<br>.

Regarding the MRI findings in cytosolic ARS, several open questions remain.. The mild supratentorial white matter T2-hyperintensity in subject #65269 (DEU) is consistent either with a complex pattern of hypomyelination with a normal signal of subcortical, late myelinating white matter or with white matter changes secondary to neurodegeneration: his visually low choline resonances in the quantitiative MRS are also consistent with hypomyelination.. The presumed hypomyelination may be compared with individuals with mutations in  DARS  (MIM: 603084),23, 24 whereas microcephaly is reminiscent of the phenotype seen in individuals with mutations in  QARS  (MIM: 603727).. A simplified gyral pattern is not apparent, however, in the individuals with mutations in  IARS .. The beneficial effect of zinc supplementation observed in human subjects could not be demonstrated in the yeast or zebrafish models.. Therefore, IARS enzyme activity seems to be independent of zinc levels and the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation is likely compensating secondary zinc deficiency.|2844.0|{'individuals', 'not'}|HP:0009879|76.0|A simplified gyral pattern is not apparent, however, in the individuals with mutations in  IARS .|simplified gyral pattern|['Simplified gyral pattern', 'Cortical gyral simplification']|0.0|#65269|1.0|0.9949919|Main Text|2820.0

The  ABCB11  variant identified in individual #83921 (AUT) may contribute to greater severity of liver disease, including cholestasis, in him than in the other individuals with compound heterozygous  IARS  mutations and no rare variants in  ABCB11 .<br>.

The pathomechanism of IARS deficiency is not yet understood.. Although reduced growth could be explained by altered global translational performance, the pathomechanism of organ-specific signs is likely to be more complex.. Given the ubiquitous presence and vital importance of ARSs in all cells of archae, bacteria, and eukarya, it is remarkable that mutations in ARSs cause considerably distinct clinical pictures with tissue-specific phenotypes in humans.1, 4, 17 Apart from aminoacylation and editing activity, the so-called canonical functions of ARSs, some ARSs exhibit non-canonical activities in vertebrates..

The beneficial effect of zinc supplementation observed in human subjects could not be demonstrated in the yeast or zebrafish models..
