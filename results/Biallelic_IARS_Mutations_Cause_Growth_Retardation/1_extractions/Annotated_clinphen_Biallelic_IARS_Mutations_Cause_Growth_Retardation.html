as the first ars-associated human disease phenotypes. since then, several clinical conditions associated with mutations in mitochondrial arss3, 4 and cytosolic arss have been identified. clinically, most cytosolic trna synthetase deficiencies are associated with cmt and related neuropathies, whereas mutations in lars (mim: 151350) cause infantile acute liver failure syndrome type 1 (mim: 615438) and autosomal-recessive mutations in mars (mim: 156560) cause interstitial lung and liver disease (mim: 615486).<br> mutations in cytosolic iars (mim: 600709) have not yet been linked to human

and coagulation parameters normalized. during episodes of liver dysfunction, the boy appeared to benefit from a high-calorie diet. alimentation was generally difficult: despite high-calorie tube feeding, weight and height remained below the 3 percentile and at 2 years of age (height -6.2 sds, weight -3.5 sds, head circumference -4.4 sds) a percutaneous gastrostomy was placed. on high-calorie

previously associated with the observed clinical phenotype or a mitochondrial disorder.10, 11 a search for homozygous or potentially compound heterozygous rare variants (maf &lt: 0.1% in 7,000 in-house exomes, 1000 genomes study) prioritized the five genes prob1 , ubr2 (mim: 609134), iars , plxnb3 (mim: 300214), and dusp21 (mim: 300678). given the overlap of clinical features of the investigated individual with the phenotypic spectrum of other ars defects, we considered iars a strong candidate. results of two independent exome sequencing studies that revealed biallelic iars variants in two unrelated individuals from austria and japan with phenotypic features like those in the german boy supplied further evidence for a causal association of biallelic iars variants with the disease presentation. all six identified iars variants were confirmed by sanger sequencing. carrier testing confirmed a compound heterozygous state of the iars variants (figure 1). except for the variant c.1252c&gt:t, which was detected three times in a heterozygous state, none of the iars variants (c.760c&gt:t, c.1109t&gt:g, c.1310c&gt:t, c.2974a&gt:g, and c.3521t&gt:a) was listed in &gt:120,000 alleles of the exome aggregation consortium (exac) server (12/2015). all the missense mutations change evolutionarily conserved amino acid residues (figure 1) and are accordingly predicted to be damaging (polyphen-2 and sift). immunoblotting analysis of fibroblast cell extracts from all three affected individuals showed reduced levels of iars protein only for subject #65269 (deu: see figure s5). immunostaining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded archival liver-biopsy material (jpn, aut) found no marking for iars in one (jpn) and normal marking in the other (aut: figure s6). four of the six mutations lie in the first half of the gene, in close proximity to the ilers core domain (figure 1).<br> to evaluate the functional relevance of identified iars variants, we made use of a tet-off yeast model. in the tet-ils1 strain, expression of ils1 , the saccharomyces cerevisiae ortholog of human iars , can be negatively regulated by addition of doxycycline to the growth medium. the strain shows normal growth under standard conditions (figure 2). reduced expression of ils1 resulted in considerable growth impairment: however, this phenotype was fully rescued by expression of the human wild-type iars cdna (figure 2, first two lines) providing an in vivo assay to evaluate mutant alleles. iars cdnas carrying the different variants were cloned into the low-copy vector pyx122 (novagen) and growth was compared to that of cells transformed with a wild-type copy of iars or with the empty vector.<br> spot assay and growth curves of tet-ils1 strain, transformed with the low copy vector pyx122 (novagen) containing different mutated versions of human iars cdna encoding the protein products "hsiars wt," pyx122:h iars : "hsiars v79l," pyx122: hiars : "hsiars i1174n," pyx122: hiars : "hsiars r418," pyx122: hiars : "hsiars r254," pyx122: hiars : "hsiars p437l," pyx122: hiars : "hsiars v370g," pyx122: hiars : and "hsiars n992d," pyx122: hiars . empty vector "pyx," pyx122, was used as a negative control. decreasing numbers of yeast cells (5 x 10, 5 x 10, 5 x 10, 5 x 10, 5 x 10) were spotted onto plates containing drop-out medium (sc-his). growth curves were obtained in liquid cultures with sc-his medium by monitoring od600. downregulation of yeast ils1 was induced by addition of 50 mg/ml doxycycline.<br> (c) growth in liquid culture. cells grown overnight were inoculated into fresh medium containing doxycycline. od600 = 0.1: growth monitored at 30degc.<br> (d) optical density after 12.5 hr of growth, expressed as percentage of wt. all variants significantly impaired the growth rate (wilcoxon test, p &lt: 0.05).<br> without addition of doxycycline, the transformed yeast strains grew like the positive control. upon downregulation of the yeast iars ortholog, no growth rescue was observed in yeast transformed with empty vector (negative control), plasmids encoding the two iars loss-of-function variants c.1252c&gt:t (p. arg418) (#65269, deu) and c.760c&gt:t (p. arg254) (#85880, jpn), or a plasmid encoding the missense variant c.2974a&gt:g (p. asn992asp) (#83921, aut). an intermediate growth phenotype was obtained by expression of the four missense variants c.235g&gt:c (p. val79leu) (not encountered in any proband: the ortholog of that in iars in cattle, which underlies weak calf syndrome), c.3521t&gt:a (p. ile1174asn) (#65269, deu), c.1310c&gt:t (p. pro437leu) (#85880, jpn), and c.1109t&gt:g (p. val370gly) (#83921, aut): the last displayed the mildest, but significant, growth impairment (figure 2). hence, each affected human individual is compound heterozygous for an iars loss-of-function allele and an allele with significantly reduced but some remaining functionality, similar to the allele causing weak calf syndrome. treatment with zinc appeared beneficial in subject #65269 (deu), possibly due to zinc deficiency or to zinc dependence of iars activity, as shown for the e. coli ortholog. supplementation using a wide range of zinc concentrations did not improve yeast growth, permitting argument that zinc has no direct effect on iars activity.<br> zebrafish were maintained and embryos were staged as described. embryos older than 24 hr after fertilization (hpf) were treated with 0.0003% phenylthiourea (sigma) to inhibit pigment synthesis and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde (pfa) previous to in situ hybridization. the in situ hybridization protocol was adapted using specific probes for the iars mrnas. the mos used were splice blocking and 5-bp-mismatch control mos, designed and synthesized by gene tools (exon 18 mo: 5'-atgtgtggtttgttttctcaccgta-3', exon 18 5-bp-mismatch 5'-atatgtagtttattttctaaccata-3': exon 32 mo: 5'-accgtctgacagcagaacacacaga-3', exon 32 5-bp mismatch: 5'-aacgtctaacagaagaacaaacaaa-3'). single-cell stage embryos were injected with 0.5 ng of mo and maintained at 28degc until the desired developmental stage was attained.<br> (d) mo-injected zebrafish embryos at 26 hpf are shown. knockdown of iars yields retarded development, brain deformity, as indicated by the arrow to the midbrain region, and severe shortening of the body axis, as highlighted by the double head arrows. left, control embryo: middle, zebrafish injected with mo targeting exon 18: right, zebrafish injected with mo targeting exon 32.<br> mutations in iars recently have been identified as underlying weak calf syndrome in japanese black cattle. the phenotype of the calf disorder strikingly resembles that of the three probands of this study. body weight in six affected calves was between 30% and 70% of that of age-matched control calves. we tested whether oxidative phosphorylation (oxphos) activity is decreased in affected calves, as findings varied within our patient cohort. oxphos activities in muscle, liver, and fibroblasts of affected calves (n = 6) were normal compared with controls (n = 3: see table s2). thus, oxphos dysfunction is not directly linked to mutations in iars in calves. we also determined blood zinc levels in 13 affected calves and 20 healthy calves. zinc levels did not differ between the two groups (table s3). hence it is likely that reduced zinc levels and impaired oxphos activities are not directly related to iars mutations.<br> liver function was basically normal in individual #65269 (deu), whereas infantile hepatopathy (leading to liver failure in one occasion) was present in the other two probands, with steatosis and portal-tract fibrosis. liver biopsy of individual #83921 (aut) additionally displayed cholestasis. among 107 rare or private variants identified in the exome of this subject was a heterozygous c.1460g&gt:a (p. arg487his) change in abcb11 (mim: 603201, genbank: nm_003742), encoding bile salt export pump (bsep). however, immunostaining of liver-biopsy material found normal bsep marking. a homozygous mutation affecting the same codon, yielding p. arg487pro, has been identified in a subject with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (mim: 601847). heterozygous abcb11 mutations are implicated as predisposing to intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy and to transient neonatal cholestasis. the abcb11 variant identified in individual #83921 (aut) may contribute to greater severity of liver disease, including cholestasis, in him than in the other individuals with compound heterozygous iars mutations and no rare variants in abcb11 .<br> regarding the mri findings in cytosolic ars, several open questions remain. the mild supratentorial white matter t2-hyperintensity in subject #65269 (deu) is consistent either with a complex pattern of hypomyelination with a normal signal of subcortical, late myelinating white matter or with white matter changes secondary to neurodegeneration: his visually low choline resonances in the quantitiative mrs are also consistent with hypomyelination. the presumed hypomyelination may be compared with individuals with mutations in dars (mim: 603084),23, 24 whereas microcephaly is reminiscent of the phenotype seen in individuals with mutations in qars (mim: 603727). a simplified gyral pattern is not apparent, however, in the individuals with mutations in iars . the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation observed in human subjects could not be demonstrated in the yeast or zebrafish models. therefore, iars enzyme activity seems to be independent of zinc levels and the beneficial effect of zinc supplementation is likely compensating secondary zinc deficiency. however, zinc has been proposed to interact with the active site of iars and to be required for normal cell growth. a role for zinc, especially in editing substrate specificity, has been demonstrated for other arss, including alanyl-, seryl-, and threonyl-trna synthetase.26, 27, 28, 29 the cause of zinc deficiency as observed in all our three probands remains unresolved, but could be explained by chronic liver disease at least in individuals aut and jpn, because chronic liver disease is known to be associated with zinc deficiency.30, 31<br> in recent years, whole-exome sequencing studies have revealed various causes of infantile liver failure with partly specific clinical phenotypes, including mutations in lars , nbas (mim: 616483),32, 33 scyl1 (mim: 616719), and now iars . precise genetic and clinical phenotyping is crucial for both understanding these diseases and for suspecting and diagnosing them in the clinical setting. this study delineates mutations in iars as underlying a multisystemic disease affecting mainly growth, brain, and liver. for reasons yet to be determined, this disease is associated with zinc deficiency and can be palliated by zinc supplementation.<br> we would like to thank the families for their
